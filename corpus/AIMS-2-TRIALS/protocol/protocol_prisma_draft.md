## TITLE

**Title – Item 1**

Autistic Participation Reporting in AIMS-2-TRIALS-Funded Research Articles: A Corpus Analysis Informed by GRIPP2-LF

---

## ABSTRACT

**Abstract – Item 2**

**Background**: AIMS‑2‑TRIALS (A2T) is the largest European autism research consortium; mapping its publication output and assessing how the participation of autistic people is reported throughout the research lifecycle is essential—especially given the consortium’s own claim that autistic individuals are "equal partners" in its work (Loth 2023, doi:10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1085445).

**Objectives**: Assemble the broadest possible corpus of research articles that declare full or partial A2T funding, and apply a participation‑indicator coding scheme (adapted from GRIPP2‑SF) to each record.

**Eligibility criteria**: Peer‑reviewed research articles (including preprints), published up to 31 May 2025 (no start‑date limit), that explicitly declare full or partial A2T funding. Editorials, commentaries, letters, conference abstracts, and protocols without results are excluded.

**Information sources**: The “Publications” page of the official A2T website, Dimensions, and Europe PMC; all sources last searched 31 May 2025.

**Analytic approach**: We will (i) quantify the proportion and yearly trajectory of research articles that report participatory components, (ii) classify the presence and type of each GRIPP2‑SF indicator, and (iii) examine how these indicators evolve over the course of the consortium’s timeline.

## INTRODUCTION

### Rationale – Item 3

Autism research has been subject to ongoing scrutiny regarding the extent and transparency of autistic people’s involvement in study design, conduct, and dissemination. AIMS‑2‑TRIALS has publicly stated its commitment to treating autistic individuals and families as equal partners in research. However, no comprehensive empirical assessment has yet examined how this commitment is reflected in the consortium’s published output. We systematically identify A2T‑funded research articles and apply GRIPP2‑LF indicators to code how autistic participation is reported, in order to quantify the frequency, typology, and temporal evolution of such reporting practices.

### Objectives – Item 4

The primary objective is to systematically identify and analyse how participation by autistic individuals is reported in AIMS‑2‑TRIALS‑funded research articles. This involves applying a coding scheme based on the GRIPP2‑SF checklist to assess the presence, type, and temporal evolution of participation‑related reporting across the corpus. Secondary objectives include characterising the reporting practices by publication year, journal, and article type; examining patterns in the presence or absence of each GRIPP2-LF item across time.

## METHODS

### Eligibility criteria – Item 5

## Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

### **Inclusion criteria**
– Peer-reviewed research articles or preprints that explicitly declare full or partial funding from AIMS-2-TRIALS.  
– This includes empirical studies, study protocols, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses.  
– The article must focus on autism—either entirely or as a substantial part of its objectives, population, methods, or analysis. This focus must be identifiable by the presence of the terms **“autism”**, **“autistic”**, or **“ASD”** in the title and/or abstract, with further confirmation from the full text when needed. 
– Articles must be written in English.
– **Funding must be explicitly stated** in the article’s funding section using either:
  - the name **“AIMS-2-TRIALS”**, or  
  - the grant number **“777394”**.  
– If “AIMS-2-TRIALS” or “777394” are mentioned **only as support** (e.g., institutional affiliation or general acknowledgment without a funding declaration), the article will only be included **if it also appears on the official AIMS-2-TRIALS “Publications” webpage**.

### **Exclusion criteria**
– Editorials, commentaries, letters, opinion pieces, perspectives, conference abstracts, corrigenda, and other non-substantive notices.  
– Articles that only mention autism superficially, without it being a central focus of the research.  
– Preprints that have since been published in a peer-reviewed journal (to avoid duplication).



### Information sources – Item 6 (PRISMA‑S 1–4 & BIBLIO 8)

Articles will be identified through three main sources:
– the “Publications” page of the official AIMS‑2‑TRIALS website;
– the Dimensions database;
– the Europe PMC platform.
All sources were last searched on 31 May 2025, and include research articles available up to that date.

### Search strategy – Item 7 (PRISMA‑S 5–16)

Provide the full search strings, filters and limits for every source so the search can be reproduced.

→

### Selection process – Item 8

Explain how records will be screened against eligibility criteria (number of reviewers, independence, automation tools).
→

### Data charting process – Item 9

Specify how data will be extracted from each record, by whom, whether independently, and any contact with study investigators.
→

### Data items – Item 10

*Participation‑indicator variables*: list and define all indicators to be coded.
→


### Synthesis methods – Item 13

Describe how coded indicators will be summarised (descriptive statistics, visualisations).

List the software packages and versions that will be used for mapping or analysis.
→

### Network analyses planned (BIBLIO 14)

Specify any planned network analyses such as co‑authorship.
