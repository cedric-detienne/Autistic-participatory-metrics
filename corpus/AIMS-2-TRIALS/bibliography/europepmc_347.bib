	Abstract = {<h4>Background: </h4> Due to the increased emphasis on co-produced and community led research, neurodiversity within research communities has sparked interest, particularly within the context of autism research. This study investigates the presence of neurodivergent researchers within a neuroscience research consortium, with a particular focus on autism prevalence. Methods Using survey data collected from active contributors to the consortium, we examined the self-reported neurodivergent status of researchers, including formal diagnoses of autism, ongoing diagnostic processes, and self-identification as neurodivergent. Results A proportion of the surveyed researchers reported formal diagnoses or self-identification as autistic (23%), that were significantly more frequent at career stages below and including postdoctoral roles (Chi-Square p-value = 0.01). Further, we identified an association between neurodivergence and a diagnosis of a mental health condition among researchers (Coef. = 1.93, p-value = 0.002), highlighting the importance of accommodating neurodiversity within research environments. Conclusions This study underscores the need for inclusivity and support for neurodivergent researchers, particularly in the context of neuroscience that does or does not yet embed participatory research initiatives. By amplifying the voices of neurodivergent researchers, research communities can enhance the equity and impact of their outcomes and foster better public engagement by sharing experiences and understanding the needs of community members.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>When working on jigsaw puzzles, we mentally "combine" two pieces to form a composite image even before physically fitting them together. This happens when the separate pieces could logically create a cohesive picture and not when they are mismatched or incoherent. The capacity of the brain to combine individual elements to form possible wholes serves as the basis of perceptual organisation. This drive for perceptual cohesion-the "Tetris effect"-can be seen in the famous game, where people automatically perceive logical combinations from separate pieces. However, it is unclear how this presents in populations known to have perceptual differences, such as autistic people. Theories on the inclination to process local over global details in autism and autistic strengths in pattern recognition lead to conflicting predictions regarding the drive for perceptual cohesion in autistic compared to non-autistic people.<h4>Methods</h4>In this large-scale (n = 470) pre-registered online behavioural study, we aimed to replicate previous research conducted on neurotypical participants and to extend this work to autistic participants. We used two tasks with Tetris-style stimuli to examine how autistic (n = 196) and non-autistic (n = 274) adults implicitly perceive possible wholes from individual parts. Data were analysed using logistic mixed-effects regression models and hierarchical Signal Detection Theory modelling.<h4>Results</h4>Overall, we replicated the results from the original study in finding participants are more likely to perceive parts as wholes when there is the potential to form a whole, compared to when there is not. However, we found no differences between autistic and non-autistic participants across both tasks.<h4>Limitations</h4>Although power calculations were carried out to assess sample sizes needed to detect a group difference, given the small effect size (Cohen's d = 0.37) in the original study, it may be that any existing group differences are still undetectable with the current sample size.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We conclude that the "Tetris effect" is ubiquitous and seen in both neurotypical and neurodiverse populations. Our findings challenge the deficit-focussed narrative often seen in the autism literature and highlight the similarities in task performance between autistic and non-autistic participants.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>The neurobiological underpinnings of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are diverse and likely multifactorial. One possible mechanism is increased oxidative stress leading to altered neurodevelopment and brain function. However, this hypothesis has mostly been tested in post-mortem studies. So far, available in vivo studies in autistic individuals have reported no differences in glutathione (GSH) levels in frontal, occipital, and subcortical regions. However, these studies were limited by the technically challenging quantification of GSH, the main brain antioxidant molecule. This study aimed to overcome previous studies' limitations by using a GSH-tailored spectroscopy sequence and optimised quantification methodology to provide clarity on GSH levels in autistic adults.<h4>Methods</h4>We used spectral editing proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) combined with linear combination model fitting to quantify GSH in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) and medial occipital cortex (mOCC) of autistic and non-autistic adults (male and female). We compared GSH levels between groups. We also examined correlations between GSH and current autism symptoms, measured using the Autism Quotient (AQ).<h4>Results</h4>Data were available from 31 adult autistic participants (24 males, 7 females) and 40 non-autistic participants (21 males, 16 females); the largest sample to date. The GSH levels did not differ between groups in either region. No correlations with AQ were observed.<h4>Conclusion</h4>GSH levels as measured using 1H-MRS are unaltered in the DMPFC and mOCC regions of autistic adults, suggesting that oxidative stress in these cortical regions is not a marked neurobiological signature of ASD.},

	Abstract = {Autism has been associated with differences in functional brain network organization. However, the exact nature of these differences across development compared to non-autistic individuals and their relationship to autism-related social cognition, remains unclear. This study first aimed to identify EEG resting-state network characteristics in autistic versus non-autistic children, adolescents, and adults. Second, we investigated associations with social cognition measures. Analyzing resting-state EEG data from the EU-AIMS Longitudinal European Autism Project, we compared network metrics (global efficiency, clustering coefficient, and small-worldness) between 344 autistic and non-autistic individuals within and across age groups in four frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, and beta). If significant, we explored their relationships to measures of empathy (empathy quotient), complex emotion recognition [reading the mind in the eyes task (RMET)], and theory of mind (animated shapes task). Compared to their non-autistic peers, autistic adolescents showed lower alpha global efficiency, while autistic adults showed lower alpha clustering and small-worldness. No network differences were observed among children. In adolescents, higher long-range integration was tentatively associated with higher RMET scores; in those with high autistic traits, higher long-range integration related to fewer parent-reported empathic behaviors. No brain-behavior relationships were observed in adults. Our findings suggest subtle differences in network topology between autistic and non-autistic individuals, with less efficient long-range efficiency during adolescence, and less local and overall network efficiency in adulthood. Furthermore, long-range integration may play a role in complex emotion recognition and empathy difficulties associated with autism in adolescence.},

	Abstract = {<title>Abstract</title> <p>Background: Autism is a heterogeneous set of neurodevelopmental conditions with a significant heritable component and perinatal origins. The earliest observable behavioural traits with which a diagnosis can be made emerge at 18 months of age. Previous studies have reported increased head circumference and brain growth in children with autism, but less is known about their early brain development in the first 6 months of life – a critical period for brain development. <h4>Methods:</h4> Data from two independent cohorts, the developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) and Cambridge Human Imaging and Longitudinal Development (CHILD), were assessed in late fetal and early infancy for brain structure with MRI. Global and regional brain volumes in the dHCP, were studied prenatally (n=106, mean age = 29.27 [SD=3.8] gestational weeks) and postnatally (n=454, mean age = 41.28 [SD=1.93] weeks post-conception) in association with later autistic traits after 18 months of age, as captured on the parent-report Quantitative Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (‘Q-CHAT’). Nominally significant findings in the dHCP were used to inform a region-of-interest analysis in the smaller independent CHILD cohort, where participants were scanned during pregnancy (mean=31.98 weeks gestation, SD=1.52) and postnatally (mean scan age=50.45, SD=2.8 weeks post-conception)(n=27). <h4>Results:</h4> After controlling for cohort covariates, such as maternal age, birth weight, sex and age post-conception at the time of scan, postnatal total brain volume, cortical grey matter volume, and white matter volume were all negatively associated with autistic traits in toddlerhood. This was found for postnatal volumes in both the dHCP and the CHILD cohort, but was not apparent when assessing prenatal brain volume or perinatal growth rates of total brain volume in the same individuals. Regional analyses in the dHCP cohort showed that postnatal white matter volume in two regions of the temporal lobe was associated with Q-CHAT scores, after controlling for total brain volume and correcting for multiple testing. Further nominal associations of regional brain volumes in the temporal lobes were noted in both the dHCP and the CHILD cohort. <h4>Conclusions:</h4> Reduced total brain volume in the first two months of life is associated with a higher number of autistic traits, as reported by parents at 18 months of life. Further research is required to understand if this extends to later ages and how it affects the development and connectivity of specific regions, particularly in the temporal lobes.</p>},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Infants vary significantly in the way they process and respond to sensory stimuli, and altered sensory processing has been reported among infants later diagnosed with autism. Previous work with adolescents and adults suggests that variability in sensory processing may have a strong genetic basis. Yet, little is known about the etiological factors influencing sensory differences in infancy, when brain circuits supporting social and non-social cognition are sculpted and learning about the world via sensory input largely occurs in interaction with caregivers.<h4>Methods</h4>We analysed data from a community sample of monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) 5-month-old same-sex twins (n = 285 pairs, n = 158 MZ pairs, n = 150 male pairs) from the BabyTwins Study in Sweden (BATSS) using exploratory factor analysis, generalised estimating equations and multivariate twin models to delineate the phenotypic and etiological structure of individual variability across different sensory processing dimensions, as measured by the Infant/Toddler Sensory Profile. Developmental links to later autistic traits were also assessed, as measured by total scores from the Quantitative Checklist for Autism in Toddlers at 36 months.<h4>Results</h4>Results suggested separability between sensory processing dimensions (i.e. sensation seeking, sensation avoiding, sensory sensitivity and low registration) at a phenotypic and etiological level, with significant contributions from additive genetics and family environment that were unique to each sensory dimension and significant but smaller contributions from shared influences. Sensory domains also showed etiological separability, with unique genetic influences to each domain, while contributions from shared environment were in part shared across domains. A higher incidence of tactile-related behaviours and behaviours associated with sensory sensitivity, sensation avoiding, and low registration were significantly associated with higher levels of autistic traits in toddlerhood.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study provides a map of the phenotypic and etiological structure of sensory processing in infancy, which will be informative for studies of both typical and atypical development.},

However, it is currently unknown whether people with PMS have similar neurocognitive atypicalities to those previously identified in idiopathic autism. Disruption in social orienting has previously been suggested as an early hallmark feature of idiopathic autism that impacts social learning and social interaction.<h4>Methods</h4>This study used a semi-naturalistic task to explore orienting to social versus non-social stimuli and its relation to clinical features in individuals diagnosed with PMS, autism, and neurotypical children recruited in the United States and the United Kingdom.<h4>Results</h4>At the group level, autistic and neurotypical children responded on average more often to social than non-social stimuli, while children with PMS responded similarly to both stimulus types. Both clinical groups responded significantly less often to social stimuli than neurotypical children. In addition, we found considerable variability in orienting responses within each group that were of clinical relevance. In the autism group, non-social orienting was associated with mental age, while in the PMS group social and non-social orienting were related to strength of autistic features.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These findings do not support specific social motivation difficulties in either clinical group. Instead, they highlight the importance of exploring individual differences in orienting responses in Phelan-McDermid Syndrome in relation to autistic features.<h4>Trial registration</h4>NA.},

In this longitudinal study, 107 children with a family history of autism and/or ADHD (FH-autism/ADHD), and 24 children with No-FH-autism/ADHD completed multiple EF tasks (5 at age 2 years, 7 at age 3 years). Parents reported on their child's autism- (Q-CHAT at age 2, SRS-2 at age 3), and ADHD-related traits (CBCL DSM-ADHD scale, both ages). Compared to the No-FH-autism/ADHD group, the FH-autism/ADHD group showed lower scores on simple EFs (involving response inhibition, and holding in mind) at ages 2 and 3. Exploratory analysis linked FH-autism specifically with lower Executive Attention (top-down attentional control) at age 2, and the combination of FH-autism and FH-ADHD with lower Complex EF (involving selectively deploying responses, or updating information) at age 3. Three-year-olds' Simple EF scores were negatively associated with ADHD-related traits. Complex EF scores were negatively associated with autism traits (before correcting for multiple comparisons). Toddlers with a family history of autism and/or ADHD may benefit from interventions to support simple EF development, whilst those already showing autistic traits may benefit from support with more-complex EF skills.},

Recent reports show that one in thirty-six 8-year-old children are autistic, signifying a considerable public health concern. According to previous studies, emotional dysregulation (ED) affects 50-60% of individuals with ASD and includes symptoms such as poor emotional control, heightened reactivity, and a low frustration tolerance. The main aims of the current study are to investigate the prevalence of ED among autistic preschoolers (below 6 years of age) and to assess the impacts of gender and intellectual disability on their emotional dysregulation profile. <b>Methods:</b> Data have been collected from three children's research hospitals in Italy (IRCCS Stella Maris Foundation, Stella Maris Mediterraneo Foundation, and IRCCS Bambino Gesù). Parents of 825 autistic pre-schooled children (mean age: 39.68 months, SD: 10.51 months) completed a general questionnaire and the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL), a reliable caregiver-reported assessment tool which provides a dysregulation profile. <b>Results:</b> A total of 30% of the children displayed a severe-to-moderate ED (emotional dysregulation) profile, with these children exhibiting significantly higher emotional-behavioral problems compared to those without ED. Males with ED exhibited greater emotional reactivity than females with ED. However, no significant relationships were found between ED and age, autism severity (ADOS-2), or intellectual disability. <b>Conclusions:</b> The results underline the importance of early, tailored interventions to face emotional challenges in young children with ASD, potentially improving long-term outcomes for this population.},

	Abstract = {The aetiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is complex and, partly, accounted by genetic factors. Nonetheless, the genetic underpinnings of ASD are poorly defined. The presence of immune dysregulations in autistic individuals, and their families, supports a role of the immune system and its genetic regulators. Albeit immune responses belong either to the innate or adaptive arms, the overall immune system genetics is broad, and encompasses a multitude of functionally heterogenous pathways which may have different influences on ASD. Hence, to gain insights on the immunogenetic underpinnings of ASD, we conducted a systematic literature review of previous immune genetic and transcription studies in ASD. We defined a list of immune genes relevant to ASD and explored their neuro-immune function. Our review confirms the presence of immunogenetic variability in ASD, accounted by inherited variations of innate and adaptive immune system genes and genetic expression changes in the blood and post-mortem brain of autistic individuals. Besides their immune function, the identified genes control neurodevelopment processes (neuronal and synaptic plasticity) and are highly expressed in pre/peri-natal periods. Hence, our synthesis bolsters the hypothesis that perturbation in immune genes may contribute to ASD by derailing the typical trajectory of neurodevelopment. Our review also helped identifying some of the limitations of prior immunogenetic research in ASD. Thus, alongside clarifying the neurodevelopment role of immune genes, we outline key considerations for future work into the aetiology of ASD and possible novel intervention targets.},

	Abstract = {<h4>ABSTRACT</h4> <h4>IMPORTANCE</h4> Autism frequently co-occurs with other mental health conditions. In the general population, these co-occurring mental health conditions are highly heritable and genetically correlated; however, the genetic architecture of co-occurring mental health conditions among autistic individuals is unclear. <h4>OBJECTIVE</h4> To investigate the relationship between common and rare genetic variation and co-occurring mental health conditions and latent factors among autistic individuals. <h4>DESIGN</h4> Cross-sectional <h4>SETTING</h4> The study was conducted with the Simons Foundation Powering Autism Research (SPARK) dataset, V9 release (12 December 2022). <h4>PARTICIPANTS</h4> Phenotypic data exploration and factor analyses was conducted in 74,204 autistic individuals, and genetic analyses were conducted in a maximum of 17,582 individuals with genetic data. <h4>MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES</h4> Genetic analysis was limited to those probands included in the SPARK iWES1 dataset [n=17,582]. SNP heritability estimates and genetic correlations were computed for three factor scores and six diagnostic categories (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or ADHD, bipolar disorder, depression, schizophrenia, anxiety disorder and disruptive behaviour disorders or DBD) using bivariate GCTA-GREML and LDSC. Polygenic scores were generated using summary statistics from the most recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) for five traits and six conditions. Associations with factor scores and categorical diagnoses were tested separately for polygenic scores (PGS), de novo variants (DNVs) and copy number variants (CNVs). <h4>RESULTS</h4> 56% of autistic individuals presented a co-occurring psychiatric condition. Confirmatory factor analysis identified three minimally correlated factors: a behavioural factor, cothymic factor, and a ‘Kraepelin’ or thought disorder factor, with SNP heritabilities ranging from 0.21 (s.e. 0.02) for behavioural to 0.09 (s.e. 0.03) for cothymic factor. Among conditions, moderate and significant SNP heritabilites were observed for ADHD (0.18, s.e. = 0.04) and DBD (0.52, s.e. = 0.08). Moderate positive genetic correlations were found between co-occurring ADHD, DBD, anxiety and the three factors in autistic individuals and corresponding conditions in external population cohorts. PGS for ADHD, depression, and educational attainment were significantly associated with all mental health factors and some of the conditions tested. We found no evidence for an association between common variants for autism, rare CNVs, and DNVs in highly constrained genes with increased likelihood of mental health phenotypes among autistic individuals. <h4>CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE</h4> Among autistic individuals, some mental health conditions and all mental health factors are heritable, but have a distinct genetic architecture from autism itself. <h4>Key Points</h4> <h4>Question</h4> Do genetic variants contribute to co-occurring mental health conditions and latent factors in autistic individuals? <h4>Findings</h4> In this cross-sectional study of 17,582 autistic individuals with and without co-occurring conditions, we found significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) heritability for co-occurring ADHD, Disruptive Behaviour Disorders (DBD), and mental-health latent factors. Co-occurring ADHD, DBD, anxiety, and all mental health factors among autistic individuals had moderate genetic correlations with corresponding case-control GWAS. We found no evidence linking common genetic variants linked to autism and rare genetic variants with increased likelihood for mental health conditions among autistic individuals. <h4>Meaning</h4> Among autistic individuals, the genetic correlates of co-occurring mental health conditions are distinct from that of autism, suggesting that additional genetic factors contribute to the development of these conditions among autistic individuals.},

	Abstract = {Atypical face processing is commonly reported in autism. Its neural correlates have been explored extensively across single neuroimaging modalities within key regions of the face processing network, such as the fusiform gyrus (FFG). Nonetheless, it is poorly understood how variation in brain anatomy and function jointly impacts face processing and social functioning. Here we leveraged a large multimodal sample to study the cross-modal signature of face processing within the FFG across four imaging modalities (structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, task-functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography) in 204 autistic and nonautistic individuals aged 7-30 years (case-control design). We combined two methodological innovations-normative modeling and linked independent component analysis-to integrate individual-level deviations across modalities and assessed how multimodal components differentiated groups and informed social functioning in autism. Groups differed significantly in a multimodal component driven by bilateral resting-state functional MRI, bilateral structure, right task-functional MRI and left electroencephalography loadings in face-selective and retinotopic FFG. Multimodal components outperformed unimodal ones in differentiating groups. In autistic individuals, multimodal components were associated with cognitive and clinical features linked to social, but not nonsocial, functioning. These findings underscore the importance of elucidating multimodal neural associations of social functioning in autism, offering potential for the identification of mechanistic and prognostic biomarkers.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Introduction</h4>Autism is a common neurodevelopmental condition with a complex genetic aetiology that includes contributions from monogenic and polygenic factors. Many autistic people have unmet healthcare needs that could be served by genomics-informed research and clinical trials. The primary aim of the European Autism GEnomics Registry (EAGER) is to establish a registry of participants with a diagnosis of autism or an associated rare genetic condition who have undergone whole-genome sequencing. The registry can facilitate recruitment for future clinical trials and research studies, based on genetic, clinical and phenotypic profiles, as well as participant preferences. The secondary aim of EAGER is to investigate the association between mental and physical health characteristics and participants' genetic profiles.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>EAGER is a European multisite cohort study and registry and is part of the AIMS-2-TRIALS consortium. EAGER was developed with input from the AIMS-2-TRIALS Autism Representatives and representatives from the rare genetic conditions community. 1500 participants with a diagnosis of autism or an associated rare genetic condition will be recruited at 13 sites across 8 countries. Participants will be given a blood or saliva sample for whole-genome sequencing and answer a series of online questionnaires. Participants may also consent to the study to access pre-existing clinical data. Participants will be added to the EAGER registry and data will be shared externally through established AIMS-2-TRIALS mechanisms.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>To date, EAGER has received full ethical approval for 11 out of the 13 sites in the UK (REC 23/SC/0022), Germany (S-375/2023), Portugal (CE-085/2023), Spain (HCB/2023/0038, PIC-164-22), Sweden (Dnr 2023-06737-01), Ireland (230907) and Italy (CET_62/2023, CEL-IRCCS OASI/24-01-2024/EM01, EM 2024-13/1032 EAGER). Findings will be disseminated via scientific publications and conferences but also beyond to participants and the wider community (eg, the AIMS-2-TRIALS website, stakeholder meetings, newsletters).},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Music therapy is the clinical use of musical interventions to improve mental and physical health across multiple domains, including social communication. Autistic children, who have difficulties in social communication and often increased anxiety, tend to show a strong preference for music, because it can be structured and systematic, and therefore more predictable than social interaction. This makes music therapy a promising medium for therapeutic support and intervention. Previous clinical trials of music therapy compared to traditional therapy for autistic children have shown encouraging but nevertheless mixed results.<h4>Key aims</h4>The primary aim is to conduct a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of improvisational music therapy for autistic children and test its effectiveness in at improving social communication and wellbeing, and to reduce anxiety.<h4>Research plan</h4>The RCT will be conducted with 200 autistic children in the UK aged 7 to 11 years old. Participants will be randomly assigned to either improvisational music therapy or support as usual. The trial will be an assessor-blind, pragmatic two-arm cluster RCT comparing the impact of 12-weeks of improvisational music therapy in addition to support as usual, vs. support as usual for autistic children.<h4>Methods</h4>Researchers who are blind to which arm the children are in will conduct assessments and obtain data via caregiver reports. The primary outcome will be the absolute change in the total score of the Brief Observation of Social Communication Change (BOSCC) assessed at baseline, T1 (13 weeks) and T2 (39 weeks) follow-ups. The BOSCC consists of specific items that were developed to identify changes in social-communication behaviours. Secondary outcome measures include: (1) Parent reported anxiety scale for youth with ASD (Note that we do not use the term 'ASD' or Autism Spectrum Disorder, because many autistic people feel it is stigmatising. Instead, we use the term 'autism') (PRAS-ASD) (2) Young Child Outcome Rating Scale, for wellbeing (YCORS), (3) Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ); and (4) Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scale (VABS). (5) The Children's Communication Checklist-2 (CCC-2) will be completed to evaluate pragmatic speech with fluent speakers only; (6) The Music Engagement Scale (MES); and (7) Assessment of the Quality of Relationship (AQR) will be used to evaluate the child-therapist relationships using video-analysis of music therapy sessions. Additional data will be collected by administering the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI-II), Music at Home Questionnaire (M@H), and children's versions of the Empathy Quotient (EQ) and Systemizing Quotient (SQ). Audio and video data from the therapy sessions will be collected and analysed (using both human and computer-based feature-coding, e.g., machine learning and AI-driven methods) to identify how music and non-musical interactions foster change throughout the therapy.<h4>Discussion</h4>This study aims to observe if the interactions, engagement, and therapeutic modalities fostered during music therapy sessions can translate to non-musical contexts and improve autistic children's social communication skills, identifying possible mediating factors contributing to the effectiveness of music therapy, potentially informing policy making and governance.<h4>Trial registration</h4>This randomised control trial is registered with the NIH U.S. National Library of Medicine:  https://clinicaltrials.gov/search?term=NCT06016621 , clinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT0601662, Registration Date 19th August 2023.},

	Abstract = {<title>Abstract</title> <p>Background The neurobiology of autism remains poorly understood. Brain sulcation is a promising proxy to assess the cortical developmental trajectory in autism spectrum disorders. We aimed to explore this neurodevelopmental marker in children with autism and its association with symptoms in a large multicentric dataset. Methods 841 children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), including 145 females, and 872 controls, including 251 females, underwent a high-resolution T1-weighted brain MRI. We processed images with the Brain VISA automatized pipeline to extract the local sulcal indices (l-SI) (the proportion of buried cortex) from 12 a priori determined brain regions for each hemisphere, covering the whole brain. We studied how the variations in regional sulcation were associated with clinical autism assessment scales (ADOS, ADI, SRS, RME), controlling for age and sex. Results Between children with ASD and controls, we found a significantly higher sulcation (l-SI) in control children compared with children with ASD in the left (<italic>p</italic> = 0.015) and right (<italic>p</italic> = 0.048) precentral regions. Within ASD children, a significant positive association was found between ADOS scores and sulcation in the right intra-parietal fissure (<italic>p</italic> = 0.049). Significant positive correlations were also found between ADI communication scores and sulcation in the left parietal region (<italic>p</italic> = 0.037), in the right medial frontal region (<italic>p</italic> = 0.035) and in the left posterior medial region (<italic>p</italic> = 0.049). Finally, significant correlations were found between l-SI and RME scores in right parietal (<italic>p</italic> = 0.037), right calcarine (<italic>p</italic> = 0.049) (positive) and left precentral regions (<italic>p</italic> = 0.014) (negative). Of note, most results were driven by girls. Limitations: p-values were not corrected for multiple comparisons. Sample size is reduced for girls’ analyses. Conclusions Our results suggest that clinical features of ASD are correlated with localized changes in cortical folding in children, mainly driven by girls. Increased symptomatic levels were associated with an increased right and decreased left sulcation, consistent with the decreased asymmetry theory of ASD. The study of cortical sulcation appears to be a promising marker of neurodevelopmental processes and their clinical correlates in ASD.</p>},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4> The expression of autism traits sufficient to meet criteria for a diagnosis can occur early (by 3 years) or later (from mid-childhood onwards). It remains unknown whether variation in age of onset is due to clinical recognition or whether it reflects distinct biological pathways. One way of addressing this question is by investigating biological differences very early in development associated with age of onset. We use a prospective design to look at event related potentials to faces, one of the most robust biomarkers in autism. <h4>Methods</h4> A sample of 102 infants (aged 6-10 months, 54% female) with an older autistic sibling had EEG recorded whilst viewing faces (faces versus noise; gaze towards versus away). Autism diagnostic assessments were conducted at three years and again in mid-childhood (aged 6-12 years), resulting in early diagnosed (at age 3; N=22), later diagnosed (at mid-childhood; N=21) and no autism (N=59) groups. <h4>Results</h4> While a short latency response (P1) does not associate with autism outcome, a mid-latency component (N290) associates with early onset autism only, and a later latency component (P400) associates with both early and later onset autism. <h4>Conclusion</h4> Temporal stages of face processing in infancy differentially associate with age of autism onset such that an earlier age of diagnosis is associated with earlier stage deviation within the event-related waveform. Early and later onset autism may represent different biological subtypes, with different early brain development, challenging the view of one etiological pathway and that variation in diagnostic age is solely due to clinical ascertainment.},

	Abstract = {Alterations in γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) have been implicated in sensory differences in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Visual signals are initially processed in the retina, and in this study, we explored the hypotheses that the GABA-dependent retinal response to light is altered in individuals with ASD. Light-adapted electroretinograms were recorded from 61 adults (38 males and 23 females; <i>n</i> = 22 ASD) in response to three stimulus protocols: (1) the standard white flash, (2) the standard 30 Hz flickering protocol, and (3) the photopic negative response protocol. Participants were administered an oral dose of placebo, 15 or 30 mg of arbaclofen (STX209, GABA<sub>B</sub> agonist) in a randomized, double-blind, crossover order before the test. At baseline (placebo), the a-wave amplitudes in response to single white flashes were more prominent in ASD, relative to typically developed (TD) participants. Arbaclofen was associated with a decrease in the a-wave amplitude in ASD, but an increase in TD, eliminating the group difference observed at baseline. The extent of this arbaclofen-elicited shift significantly correlated with the arbaclofen-elicited shift in cortical responses to auditory stimuli as measured by using an electroencephalogram in our prior study and with broader autistic traits measured with the autism quotient across the whole cohort. Hence, GABA-dependent differences in retinal light processing in ASD appear to be an accessible component of a wider autistic difference in the central processing of sensory information, which may be upstream of more complex autistic phenotypes.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Importance</h4>In the neurotypical brain, regions develop in coordinated patterns, providing a fundamental scaffold for brain function and behavior. Whether altered patterns contribute to clinical profiles in neurodevelopmental conditions, including autism, remains unclear.<h4>Objectives</h4>To examine if, in autism, brain regions develop differently in relation to each other and how these differences are associated with molecular/genomic mechanisms and symptomatology.<h4>Design, setting, and participants</h4>This study was an analysis of one the largest deep-phenotyped, case-control, longitudinal (2 assessments separated by approximately 12-24 months) structural magnetic resonance imaging and cognitive-behavioral autism datasets (EU-AIMS Longitudinal European Autism Project [LEAP]; study dates, February 2014-November 2017) and an out-of-sample validation in the Brain Development Imaging Study (BrainMapASD) independent cohort. Analyses were performed during the 2022 to 2023 period. This multicenter study included autistic and neurotypical children, adolescents, and adults. Autistic participants were included if they had an existing autism diagnosis (DSM-IV/International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision or DSM-5 criteria). Autistic participants with co-occurring psychiatric conditions (except psychosis/bipolar disorder) and those taking regular medications were included.<h4>Exposures</h4>Neuroanatomy of neurotypical and autistic participants.<h4>Main outcomes and measures</h4>Intraindividual changes in surface area and cortical thickness over time, analyzed via surface-based morphometrics.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 386 individuals in the LEAP cohort (6-31 years at first visit; 214 autistic individuals, mean [SD] age, 17.3 [5.4] years; 154 male [72.0%] and 172 neurotypical individuals, mean [SD] age, 16.35 [5.7] years; 108 male [62.8%]) and 146 individuals in the BrainMapASD cohort (11-18 years at first visit; 49 autistic individuals, mean [SD] age, 14.31 [2.4] years; 42 male [85.7%] and 97 neurotypical individuals, mean [SD] age, 14.10 [2.5] years; 58 male [59.8%]). Maturational between-group differences in cortical thickness and surface area were established that were mostly driven by sensorimotor regions (eg, across features, absolute loadings for early visual cortex ranged from 0.07 to 0.11, whereas absolute loadings for dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ranged from 0.005 to 0.06). Neurodevelopmental differences were transcriptomically enriched for genes expressed in several cell types and during various neurodevelopmental stages, and autism candidate genes (eg, downregulated genes in autism, including those regulating synaptic transmission; enrichment odds ratio =3.7; P =2.6 × -10). A more neurotypical, less autismlike maturational profile was associated with fewer social difficulties and more typical sensory processing (false discovery rate P <.05; Pearson r ≥0.17). Results were replicated in the independently collected BrainMapASD cohort.<h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4>Results of this case-control study suggest that the coordinated development of brain regions was altered in autism, involved a complex interplay of temporally sensitive molecular mechanisms, and may be associated with both lower-order (eg, sensory) and higher-order (eg, social) clinical features of autism. Thus, examining maturational patterns may provide an analytic framework to study the neurobiological origins of clinical profiles in neurodevelopmental/mental health conditions.},

	Abstract = {Infants at elevated likelihood for or later diagnosed with autism typically have smaller vocabularies than their peers, as shown by the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) and the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Developmental Inventory (CDI). However, the extent to which MSEL and CDI scores align remains unclear, especially across clinical and non-clinical populations. This study examined whether the concurrent validity of the MSEL and CDI differs based on autism likelihood and diagnosis. Data from 720 14-month-old infants were analysed, grouped by likelihood (elevated vs. typical) and diagnosis at 36 months (diagnosed vs. not diagnosed). Vocabulary scores were compared across both likelihood and diagnostic groups. Moderate correlations were observed between the MSEL and CDI in most groups (r<sub>s</sub> range = [.34-.58]). One exception was that the expressive scores of elevated likelihood infants on the MSEL and CDI were more closely associated than the expressive scores of typical likelihood infants. Diagnosed infants had lower vocabulary scores than non-diagnosed peers on both the MSEL and CDI. The elevated likelihood group showed lower scores on the MSEL but not the CDI compared to typical likelihood infants. The moderate correlations suggest that the MSEL and CDI assess different aspects of language in infancy. These associations were weaker than previously reported in autistic children. Differences in vocabulary scores across likelihood and diagnostic groups highlight the need for further research to understand the association between these measures.},

Clinicians lack predictive tools to identify those who will later be diagnosed with co-occurring intellectual disability (ID).<h4>Objective</h4>To predict ID in children diagnosed with autism.<h4>Design, setting, and participants</h4>This prognostic study involved the development and validation of models integrating genetic variants and developmental milestones to predict ID. Models were trained, cross-validated, and tested for generalizability across 3 autism cohorts: Simons Foundation Powering Autism Research (SPARK), Simons Simplex Collection, and MSSNG. Autistic participants were assessed older than 6 years of age for ID. Study data were analyzed from January 2023 to July 2024.<h4>Exposures</h4>Ages at attaining early developmental milestones, occurrence of language regression, polygenic scores for cognitive ability and autism, rare copy number variants, de novo loss-of-function and missense variants impacting constrained genes.<h4>Main outcomes and measures</h4>The out-of-sample performance of predictive models was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), positive predictive values (PPVs), and negative predictive values (NPVs).<h4>Results</h4>A total of 5633 autistic participants (4574 male [81.2%]) were included in this analysis. On average, participants were diagnosed with autism at 4 (IQR, 3-7) years of age and assessed for ID at 11 (8-14) years of age, with 1159 participants (20.6%) being diagnosed with ID. The model integrating all predictors yielded an AUROC of 0.653 (95% CI, 0.625-0.681), and this predictive performance was cross-validated and generalized across cohorts. This modest performance reflected that only a subset of individuals carried large-effect variants, high polygenic scores, or presented delayed milestones. However, combinations of genetic variants that are typically not considered clinically relevant by diagnostic laboratories achieved PPVs of 55% and correctly identified 10% of individuals developing ID. The addition of polygenic scores to developmental milestones specifically improved NPVs rather than PPVs. Notably, the ability to stratify ID probabilities using genetic variants was up to 2-fold higher in individuals with delayed milestones compared with those with typical development.<h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4>Results of this prognostic study suggest that the growing number of neurodevelopmental condition-associated variants cannot, in most cases, be used alone for predicting ID. However, models combining different classes of variants with developmental milestones provide clinically relevant individual-level predictions that could be useful for targeting early interventions.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Autistic people and transgender/gender diverse people experience poorer healthcare experiences and greater risk of diagnosed, suspected, and assessment recommended health conditions, compared to non-autistic and cisgender individuals, respectively. Despite this, there is a paucity of studies on the healthcare experiences and health outcomes of transgender/gender diverse autistic individuals.<h4>Methods</h4>We compared the healthcare experiences and health outcomes of cisgender autistic (n = 1094), transgender/gender diverse autistic (n = 174), and cisgender non-autistic adults (n = 1295) via an anonymous, self-report survey. All individuals whose sex assigned at birth did not match their current gender identity were categorized as transgender/gender diverse; this was possible to determine, as the survey asked about sex assigned at birth and gender in separate questions. Unfortunately, n = 57 transgender/gender diverse non-autistic participants were excluded from these analyses a priori, due to low power. Unadjusted and adjusted binomial logistic regression models with FDR correction were employed to assess healthcare experiences and rates of co-occurring mental and physical health conditions.<h4>Results</h4>Both transgender/gender diverse and cisgender autistic adults had higher rates of all health conditions (including conditions that are formally diagnosed, suspected, or recommended for assessment), compared to cisgender non-autistic adults. Transgender/gender diverse autistic adults were 2.3 times more likely to report a physical health condition, 10.9 times more likely to report a mental health condition, and 5.8 times more likely to report self-harm than cisgender non-autistic adults. Both autistic groups also reported significantly poorer healthcare experiences across 50/51 items.<h4>Limitations</h4>These data were not originally collected to understand the experiences of transgender/gender diverse individuals. In addition, our recruitment strategies, use of a convenience sampling method, and the use of a self-report survey limit the generalizability of the study. As our sample was biased towards white individuals, UK residents, relatively highly educated individuals, those assigned female at birth, and those who currently identify as female, our findings may be less applicable to individuals of differing demographics. Finally, the present study does not include information on the experiences of transgender/gender diverse non-autistic people.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Autistic people have poorer self-reported health and healthcare; however, being gender diverse is associated with further risk for certain adverse experiences and outcomes. Future research on the health and healthcare experiences of transgender/gender diverse autistic people is urgently needed. In particular, forthcoming studies in this area should aim to recruit large-scale and representative studies and should compare the experiences of transgender/gender diverse autistic people to those of transgender/gender diverse non-autistic people. Greater recognition of challenges and reasonable adjustments are essential for people with marginalized, intersectional identities in clinical practice.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background: </h4> The neurobiological underpinnings of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are diverse and likely multifactorial. One possible mechanism is increased oxidative stress leading to altered neurodevelopment and brain function. However, this hypothesis has mostly been tested in post-mortem studies. So far, available in vivo studies in autistic individuals have reported no differences in glutathione (GSH) levels in frontal, occipital, and subcortical regions. However, these studies were limited by the technically challenging quantification of GSH, the main brain antioxidant molecule. This study aimed to overcome previous studies limitations by using GSH-tailored spectroscopy sequences and optimised quantification methodology to provide clarity on GSH levels in autistic adults. Methods We used spectral editing proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1 H-MRS) combined with linear combination model fitting to quantify GSH in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) and medial occipital cortex (mOCC) of autistic and non-autistic adults (male and female). We compared GSH levels between groups, also considering biological sex effects. We also examined correlations between GSH and current autism symptoms, measured using the Autism Quotient (AQ). Results Data were available from 31 adult autistic participants (24 males, 7 females) and 40 non-autistic participants (21 males, 16 females); the largest sample to date. The GSH levels did not differ between groups in either region. No biological sex-effects or correlations with AQ were observed. Limitations : Our study was limited to two brain regions, but GSH levels may be altered in other regions. Additionally, we do not know if our findings generalise to other cohorts (e.g. those with intellectual disability or epilepsy). Oxidative stress can be captured more comprehensively through the ratio of GSH to glutathione disulphide (GSSG), however GSSG concentration is not detectable with 1 H-MRS, thus we cannot rule out the possibility that GSSG levels, and consequently GSH/GSSG ratios were altered in this ASD cohort. Conclusions GSH levels as measured using 1 H-MRS are unaltered in the DMPFC and mOCC regions of autistic adults, suggesting that oxidative stress in these cortical regions is not a marked neurobiological signature of ASD.},

	Abstract = {Predictive processing accounts of autism posit that autistic individuals' perception is less biased by expectations than nonautistic individuals', perhaps through stronger precision-weighting of prediction errors. Since precision-weighting is fundamental to all information processing, under this theory, the differences between autistic and nonautistic individuals should be domain-general and observable in both behavior and brain responses. This study used EEG, behavioral responses, and eye-tracking co-registration during gaze-direction adaptation, to investigate whether increased precision-weighting of prediction errors is evident through smaller adaptation after-effects in autistic adolescents compared with nonautistic peers. Multilevel modeling showed that autistic and nonautistic adolescents' responses were consistent with behavioral adaptation, with Bayesian statistics providing extremely strong evidence for the absence of a group difference. Cluster-based permutation testing of ERP responses did not show the expected adaptation after-effect but did show habituation to repeated stimulus presentation, and no group difference was detected, a result not consistent with the theoretical account. Combined with the few other available studies, the current findings raise challenges for the theory, suggesting no fundamental difference in precision-weighting of prediction errors in autism.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Autism is a lifelong complex neurodevelopmental condition that affects brain development and behaviour with significant consequences for everyday life. Despite its personal, familial, and societal impact, Europe-wide harmonised guidelines are still lacking for early detection, diagnosis, and intervention, leading to an overall unsatisfactory autistic person and carer journey.<h4>Methods</h4>The care pathway for autistic children and adolescents was analysed in Italy, Spain and the UK from the perspective of carers (using a survey aimed at caregivers of autistic children 0-18 years old), the autistic community, and professionals in order to identify major barriers (treatment gaps) preventing carers from receiving information, support, and timely screening/diagnosis and intervention.<h4>Results</h4>Across all three countries, analysis of the current care pathway showed: long waits from the time carers raised their first concerns about a child's development and/or behaviour until screening and confirmed diagnosis; delayed or no access to intervention once a diagnosis was confirmed; limited information about autism and how to access early detection services; and deficient support for families throughout the journey.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These findings call for policy harmonisation in Europe to shorten long wait times for diagnosis and intervention and therefore, improve autistic people and their families' journey experience and quality of life.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Lay abstract</h4>Autistic individuals are more likely than non-autistic individuals to experience a mental health condition in their lifetime, and this includes externalising and internalising symptoms. We know very little about how different environments and family conditions impact these symptoms for autistic individuals. Improving our understanding of these relationships is important so that we can identify individuals who may be in greater need of support. In this article, we seek to improve our understanding of how environmental and family conditions impact externalising and internalising symptoms in autistic and non-autistic people. To do this, we conducted analyses with two cohorts in very different settings - in Europe and South Africa - to ensure our findings are globally representative. We used advanced statistical methods to establish environmental and family conditions that were similar to each other, and which could be combined into specific 'factors'. We found that four similar 'factors' could be identified in the two cohorts. These were distinguished by personal characteristics and environmental conditions of individuals, and were named Person Characteristics, Family System, Parental and Material Resources. Interestingly, just 'Family System' was associated with internalising and externalising symptoms, and this was the same in both cohorts. We also found that having high traits of autism impacted this relationship between Family System and mental health conditions with opposite directions in the two settings. These results show that characteristics in the Family System are associated with internalising and externalising symptoms, and autistic persons are particularly impacted, reinforcing the notion that family stressors are important to consider when implementing policy and practice related to improving the mental health of autistic people.},

	Abstract = {Common genetic variation has been associated with multiple phenotypic features in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). However, our knowledge of shared genetic factor structures contributing to this highly heterogeneous phenotypic spectrum is limited. Here, we developed and implemented a structural equation modelling framework to directly model genomic covariance across core and non-core ASD phenotypes, studying autistic individuals of European descent with a case-only design. We identified three independent genetic factors most strongly linked to language performance, behaviour and developmental motor delay, respectively, studying an autism community sample (N = 5331). The three-factorial structure was largely confirmed in independent ASD-simplex families (N = 1946), although we uncovered, in addition, simplex-specific genetic overlap between behaviour and language phenotypes. Multivariate models across cohorts revealed novel associations, including links between language and early mastering of self-feeding. Thus, the common genetic architecture in ASD is multi-dimensional with overarching genetic factors contributing, in combination with ascertainment-specific patterns, to phenotypic heterogeneity.},

Their neural correlates have been explored extensively across single neuroimaging modalities within key regions of the face processing network, such as the fusiform gyrus (FFG). Nonetheless, it is poorly understood how different variation(s) in brain anatomy and function <italic>combine</italic> to impact face processing and social functioning. Extracting the shared information across different modalities is essential to derive a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying autism. Here, we leveraged a large multimodal sample to study the cross-modal signature of face processing within the FFG across four imaging modalities (structural MRI, resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI], task-fMRI and EEG) in 204 individuals aged 7-30years comprising both autistic and non-autistic individuals (NAI). Combining two methodological innovations – normative modeling and linked independent component analysis – we integrated individual-level deviations across modalities to assess the efficacy of multimodal components in differentiating autistic from NAI and informing autism-associated social functioning. Autistic individuals differed significantly in a multimodal component, driven by bilateral rs-fMRI, bilateral structure, right task-fMRI, and left EEG loadings involving face-selective and retinotopic FFG regions. Multimodal components outperformed unimodal ones in differentiating autistic from NAI. Within the autism group, there was a significant multivariate association between multimodal components and a set of cognitive and clinical features associated with social functioning but not non-social features. These findings underscore the importance of elucidating individual-level, integrated neural associations of core social functioning in autism, offering potential for refined stratification and the identification of mechanistic and prognostic biomarkers.</p>},

	Abstract = {Face-processing timing differences may underlie visual social attention differences between autistic and non-autistic people, and males and females. This study investigates the timing of the effects of neurotype and sex on face-processing, and their dependence on age. We analysed EEG data during upright and inverted photographs of faces from 492 participants from the Longitudinal European Autism Project (141 neurotypical males, 76 neurotypical females, 202 autistic males, 73 autistic females; age 6-30 years). We detected timings of sex/diagnosis effects on event-related potential amplitudes at the posterior-temporal channel P8 with Bootstrapped Cluster-based Permutation Analysis and conducted Growth Curve Analysis (GCA) to investigate the timecourse and dependence on age of neural signals. The periods of influence of neurotype and sex overlapped but differed in onset (respectively, 260 and 310 ms post-stimulus), with sex effects lasting longer. GCA revealed a smaller and later amplitude peak in autistic female children compared to non-autistic female children; this difference decreased in adolescence and was not significant in adulthood. No age-dependent neurotype difference was significant in males. These findings indicate that sex and neurotype influence longer latency face processing and implicates cognitive rather than perceptual processing. Sex may have more overarching effects than neurotype on configural face processing.},

At 3 years CBE was determined using DSM-5 criteria. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were estimated. Autism recurrence rate was 25.7% [95% CI (21.1, 30.6)]. Q-CHAT sensitivity was 31.8% [95% CI (21.4, 43.6)] at 14 m and 30.6% [95% CI (20.7, 41.7)] at 24 m. Specificity was 81.2% [95% CI (75.4, 86.2)] at 14 m and 94.8% [95% CI (91.2, 97.2)] at 24 m. PPV was 35.6% [95% CI (24.2, 48.2)] at 14 m and 66.7% [95% CI (49.8, 81.1)] at 24 m. NPV was 78.5% [95% CI (72.6, 83.7)] and 79.9% [95% CI (74.7, 84.6)] respectively. ADOS-2 demonstrated a of 64.3% [95% CI (45.9, 80.2)] and 69.3% [95% CI (58.4, 79.0)] and a specificity of 71.1% [95% CI (60.3, 80.4)] and 68.7% [95% CI (62.5, 74.5)] at 14 m and 24 m respectively.

	Abstract = {Altered reactivity and responses to auditory input are core to the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Preclinical models implicate ϒ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in this process. However, the link between GABA and auditory processing in humans (with or without ASD) is largely correlational. As part of a study of potential biosignatures of GABA function in ASD to inform future clinical trials, we evaluated the role of GABA in auditory repetition suppression in 66 adults (n = 28 with ASD). Neurophysiological responses (temporal and frequency domains) to repetitive standard tones and novel deviants presented in an oddball paradigm were compared after double-blind, randomized administration of placebo, 15 or 30 mg of arbaclofen (STX209), a GABA type B (GABA<sub>B</sub>) receptor agonist. We first established that temporal mismatch negativity was comparable between participants with ASD and those with typical development (TD). Next, we showed that temporal and spectral responses to repetitive standards were suppressed relative to responses to deviants in the two groups, but suppression was significantly weaker in individuals with ASD at baseline. Arbaclofen reversed weaker suppression of spectral responses in ASD but disrupted suppression in TD. A post hoc analysis showed that arbaclofen-elicited shift in suppression was correlated with autistic symptomatology measured using the Autism Quotient across the entire group, though not in the smaller sample of the ASD and TD group when examined separately. Thus, our results confirm: GABAergic dysfunction contributes to the neurophysiology of auditory sensory processing alterations in ASD, and can be modulated by targeting GABA<sub>B</sub> activity. These GABA-dependent sensory differences may be upstream of more complex autistic phenotypes.},

	Abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common and complex neurodevelopmental condition. The pathophysiology of ASD is poorly defined; however, it includes a strong genetic component and there is increasing evidence to support a role of immune dysregulation. Nonetheless, it is unclear which immune phenotypes link to ASD through genetics. Hence, we investigated the genetic correlation between ASD and diverse classes of immune conditions and markers; and if these immune-related genetic factors link to specific autistic-like traits in the population. We estimated global and local genetic correlations between ASD (n = 55,420) and 11 immune phenotypes (n = 14,256-755,406) using genome-wide association study summary statistics. Subsequently, polygenic scores (PGS) for these immune phenotypes were calculated in a population-based sample (n = 2487) and associated to five autistic-like traits (i.e., attention to detail, childhood behaviour, imagination, rigidity, social skills), and a total autistic-like traits score. Sex-stratified PGS analyses were also performed. At the genome-wide level, ASD was positively correlated with allergic diseases (ALG), and negatively correlated with lymphocyte count, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (FDR-p = 0.01-0.02). At the local genetic level, ASD was correlated with RA, C-reactive protein, and granulocytes and lymphocyte counts (p = 5.8 × 10<sup>-6</sup>-0.002). In the general population sample, increased genetic liability for SLE, RA, ALG, and lymphocyte levels, captured by PGS, was associated with the total autistic score and with rigidity and childhood behaviour (FDR-p = 0.03). In conclusion, we demonstrated a genetic relationship between ASD and immunity that depends on the type of immune phenotype considered; some increase likelihood whereas others may potentially help build resilience. Also, this relationship may be restricted to specific genetic loci and link to specific autistic dimensions (e.g., rigidity).},

However, previous research has largely relied upon association or correlation studies to link differences in serotonin targets to autism. To directly establish that serotonergic signalling is involved in a candidate brain function our approach is to change it and observe a shift in that function. We will use psilocybin as a pharmacological probe of the serotonin system in vivo. We will directly test the hypothesis that serotonergic targets of psilocybin - principally, but not exclusively, 5HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor pathways-function differently in autistic and non-autistic adults.<h4>Methods</h4>The 'PSILAUT' "shiftability" study is a case-control study autistic and non-autistic adults. How neural responses 'shift' in response to low doses (2 mg and 5 mg) of psilocybin compared to placebo will be examined using multimodal techniques including functional MRI and EEG. Each participant will attend on up to three separate visits with drug or placebo administration in a double-blind and randomized order.<h4>Results</h4>This study will provide the first direct evidence that the serotonin targets of psilocybin function differently in the autistic and non-autistic brain. We will also examine individual differences in serotonin system function.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This work will inform our understanding of the neurobiology of autism as well as decisions about future clinical trials of psilocybin and/or related compounds including stratification approaches.<h4>Trial registration</h4>NCT05651126.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental conditions accompanied by differences in brain development. Neuroanatomical differences in autism are variable across individuals and likely underpin distinct clinical phenotypes. To parse heterogeneity, it is essential to establish how the neurobiology of ASD is modulated by differences associated with co-occurring conditions, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This study aimed to (1) investigate between-group differences in autistic individuals with and without co-occurring ADHD, and to (2) link these variances to putative genomic underpinnings.<h4>Methods</h4>We examined differences in cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA) and their genomic associations in a sample of 533 individuals from the Longitudinal European Autism Project. Using a general linear model including main effects of autism and ADHD, and an ASD-by-ADHD interaction, we examined to which degree ADHD modulates the autism-related neuroanatomy. Further, leveraging the spatial gene expression data of the Allen Human Brain Atlas, we identified genes whose spatial expression patterns resemble our neuroimaging findings.<h4>Results</h4>In addition to significant main effects for ASD and ADHD in fronto-temporal, limbic, and occipital regions, we observed a significant ASD-by-ADHD interaction in the left precentral gyrus and the right frontal gyrus for measures of CT and SA, respectively. Moreover, individuals with ASD + ADHD differed in CT to those without. Both main effects and the interaction were enriched for ASD-but not for ADHD-related genes.<h4>Limitations</h4>Although we employed a multicenter design to overcome single-site recruitment limitations, our sample size of N = 25 individuals in the ADHD only group is relatively small compared to the other subgroups, which limits the generalizability of the results. Also, we assigned subjects into ADHD positive groupings according to the DSM-5 rating scale. While this is sufficient for obtaining a research diagnosis of ADHD, our approach did not take into account for how long the symptoms have been present, which is typically considered when assessing ADHD in the clinical setting.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Thus, our findings suggest that the neuroanatomy of ASD is significantly modulated by ADHD, and that autistic individuals with co-occurring ADHD may have specific neuroanatomical underpinnings potentially mediated by atypical gene expression.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Do autistic people share the same moral foundations as typical people? Here we built on two prominent theories in psychology, moral foundations theory and the empathizing-systemizing (E-S) theory, to observe the nature of morality in autistic people and systemizers.<h4>Methods</h4>In dataset 1, we measured five foundations of moral judgements (Care, Fairness, Loyalty, Authority, and Sanctity) measured by the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ) in autistic (n = 307) and typical people (n = 415) along with their scores on the Empathy Quotient (EQ) and Systemizing Quotient (SQ). In dataset 2, we measured these same five foundations along with E-S cognitive types (previously referred to as "brain types") in a large sample of typical people (N = 7595).<h4>Results</h4>Autistic people scored the same on Care (i.e., concern for others) as typical people (h1). Their affective empathy (but not their cognitive empathy) scores were positively correlated with Care. Autistic people were more likely to endorse Fairness (i.e., giving people what they are owed, and treating them with justice) over Care (h2). Their systemizing scores were positively correlated with Fairness. Autistic people or those with a systemizing cognitive profile had lower scores on binding foundations: Loyalty, Authority, and Sanctity (h3). Systemizing in typical people was positively correlated with Liberty (i.e., hypervigilance against oppression), which is a sixth moral foundation (h4). Although the majority of people in all five E-S cognitive types self-identified as liberal, with a skew towards empathizing (h5), the percentage of libertarians was highest in systemizing cognitive types (h6). E-S cognitive types accounted for 2 to 3 times more variance for Care than did sex.<h4>Limitations</h4>Our study is limited by its reliance on self-report measures and a focus on moral judgements rather than behavior or decision-making. Further, only dataset 2 measured political identification, therefore we were unable to assess politics in autistic people.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We conclude that some moral foundations in autistic people are similar to those in typical people (despite the difficulties in social interaction that are part of autism), and some are subtly different. These subtle differences vary depending on empathizing and systemizing cognitive types.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Structural differences exist in the brains of autistic individuals. To date only a few studies have explored the relationship between fetal brain growth and later infant autistic traits, and some have used fetal head circumference (HC) as a proxy for brain development. These findings have been inconsistent. Here we investigate whether fetal subregional brain measurements correlate with autistic traits in toddlers.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 219 singleton pregnancies (104 males and 115 females) were recruited at the Rosie Hospital, Cambridge, UK. 2D ultrasound was performed at 12-, 20- and between 26 and 30 weeks of pregnancy, measuring head circumference (HC), ventricular atrium (VA) and transcerebellar diameter (TCD). A total of 179 infants were followed up at 18-20 months of age and completed the quantitative checklist for autism in toddlers (Q-CHAT) to measure autistic traits.<h4>Results</h4>Q-CHAT scores at 18-20 months of age were positively associated with TCD size at 20 weeks and with HC at 28 weeks, in univariate analyses, and in multiple regression models which controlled for sex, maternal age and birth weight.<h4>Limitations</h4>Due to the nature and location of the study, ascertainment bias could also have contributed to the recruitment of volunteer mothers with a higher than typical range of autistic traits and/or with a significant interest in the neurodevelopment of their children.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Prenatal brain growth is associated with toddler autistic traits and this can be ascertained via ultrasound starting at 20 weeks gestation.},

	Abstract = {<title>Abstract</title> <p>Autism and ADHD are characterised by atypical sensory responsivity, and this may be driven by alterations in the balance of cortical excitation to inhibition (E/I). Studies in early development are required to establish the primary of effects. We utilised data from a prospective longitudinal cohort of infants with and without a family history (FH) of autism and/or ADHD (N=151; 55% male, 83% white). We extracted electroencephalography (EEG) metrics of E/I balance at 5, 10 and 14 months; the aperiodic exponent of the slope of the power spectrum (‘1/f’). Models estimated correlated latent growth curves of parent-reported hyper and hypo-responsivity between 10 – 36 months. Analyses tested associations between developmental trajectories of sensory responsivity and FH, parent-rated neurodevelopmental traits at 3 years and E/I balance. Results showed that FH-autism was associated with steeper increases in parent-reported hyper-responsivity between 10 to 36 months, whereas FH-ADHD was associated with steeper increases in hypo-responsivity. Higher hypo-responsivity at 10-month baseline was associated with both autistic and ADHD traits at 3 years. A steeper slope of hypo-responsivity predicted ADHD traits at 3 years. Neither the baseline or slope of hyper-responsivity was associated with FH-ADHD, or autistic or ADHD traits at 3 years. Males displayed higher baseline hypo-responsivity. Aperiodic exponent values at 5 and 10, but not 14 months, were associated with hyper-responsivity. Results suggest that hypo-responsivity in infancy may be an indicator of later autism and ADHD outcomes. Alterations in E/I balance may contribute to early differences in sensory responsivity and thus could represent a useful target for intervention development.</p>},

	Abstract = {Longitudinal research can assess how diverging development of multiple cognitive skills during infancy, as well as familial background, are related to the emergence of neurodevelopmental conditions. Sensorimotor and effortful control difficulties are seen in infants later diagnosed with autism; this study explored the relationships between these skills and autism characteristics in 340 infants (240 with elevated familial autism likelihood) assessed at 4-7, 8-10, 12-15, 24, and 36 months. We tested: (1) the relationship between parent-reported effortful control (Rothbart's temperament questionnaires) and sensorimotor skills (Mullen Scales of Early Learning), using random intercept cross-lagged panel modelling; (2) whether household income and maternal education predicted stable individual differences in cognition; (3) sensorimotor and effortful control skills as individual and interactive predictors of parent-reported autism characteristics (Social Responsiveness Scale) at 3 years, using multiple regression; and (4) moderation of interactions by familial likelihood. Sensorimotor skills were longitudinally associated with effortful control at the subsequent measurement point from 12-15 months. Socioeconomic status indicators did not predict stable between-infant differences in sensorimotor or effortful control skills. Effortful control skills were longitudinally related to 3-year autism characteristics from the first year of life, with evidence for an interaction with sensorimotor skills at 24 months. Effects of effortful control increased with age and were particularly important for infants with family histories of autism. Results are discussed in relation to different theoretical frameworks: Developmental Cascades and Anterior Modifiers in the Emergence of Neurodevelopmental Disorders. We suggest a role for 24-month effortful control in explaining the emergent autism phenotype. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS: Sensorimotor skills longitudinally predicted effortful control from 12-15 months onward but effortful control did not longitudinally predict sensorimotor skills during infancy. Measures of effortful control skills taken before the age of 1 predicted continuous variation in autism characteristics at 36 months, with associations increasing in strength with age. Effortful control (measured at 12-15 and 24 months) was a stronger predictor of 36-month autism characteristics in infants with elevated familial likelihood for autism. The relationship between 24-month sensorimotor skills and 36-month autism characteristics was stronger in infants with weaker effortful control skills.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Existing evidence indicates that atypical sensory reactivity is a core characteristic of autism, and has been linked to both anxiety (and its putative infant precursor of fearfulness) and repetitive behaviours. However, most work has used cross-sectional designs and not considered the differential roles of hyperreactivity and hyporeactivity to sensory inputs, and is thus limited in specificity.<h4>Methods</h4>161 infants with and without an elevated likelihood of developing autism and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were followed from 10 to 36 months of age. Parents rated an infant precursor of later anxiety (fearfulness) using the Infant Behaviour Questionnaire at 10 and 14 months, and the Early Childhood Behavioural Questionnaire at 24 months, and sensory hyperreactivity and hyporeactivity at 10, 14 and 24 months using the Infant Toddler Sensory Profile. Domains of autistic traits (restrictive and repetitive behaviours; RRB, and social communication interaction, SCI) were assessed using the parent-rated Social Responsiveness Scale at 36 months. Cross-lagged models tested (a) paths between fearfulness and hyperreactivity at 10-24 months, and from fearfulness and hyperreactivity to later autism traits, (b) the specificity of hyperreactivity effects by including hyporeactivity as a correlated predictor.<h4>Results</h4>Hyperreactivity at 14 months was positively associated with fearfulness at 24 months, and hyperreactivity at 24 months was positively associated with SCI and RRB at 36 months. When hyporeactivity was included in the model, paths between hyperreactivity and fearfulness remained, but paths between hyperreactivity and autistic traits became nonsignificant.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings indicate that alterations in early sensory reactivity may increase the likelihood of showing fearfulness in infancy, and relate to later social interactions and repetitive behaviours, particularly in individuals with a family history of autism or ADHD.},

Epilepsy and other associated conditions have a substantial impact on the well-being of autistic people and their families, reduce quality of life, and increase premature mortality. Despite this, there is a lack of studies investigating the care pathway of autistic children with co-occurring epilepsy in Europe.<h4>Methods</h4>We analyzed the care pathway for autistic children with associated epilepsy in Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom from the perspective of caregivers (using a survey aimed at caregivers of autistic children 0-18 years old), the autistic community, and professionals, in order to identify major barriers preventing caregivers and autistic children from receiving timely screening and treatment of possible co-occurring epilepsy.<h4>Results</h4>Across all three countries, an analysis of the current care pathway showed a lack of systematic screening of epilepsy in all autistic children, lack of treatment of co-occurring epilepsy, and inappropriate use of antiepileptic drugs. A major challenge is the lack of evidence-based harmonized guidelines for autism with co-occurring epilepsy in these countries.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings show both heterogeneity and major gaps in the care pathway for autism with associated epilepsy and the great efforts that caregivers must make for timely screening, diagnosis, and adequate management of epilepsy in autistic children. We call for policy harmonization in Europe in order to improve the experiences and quality of life of autistic people and their families.},

	Abstract = {Autism sibling recurrence in prospective infant family history studies is ~20% at 3 years but systematic follow-up to mid-childhood is rare. In population and clinical cohorts autism is not recognized in some children until school-age or later. One hundred and fifty-nine infants with an older sibling with autism underwent research diagnostic assessments at 3 years and mid-childhood (6 to 12 years (mean 9)). We report the autism sibling recurrence rate in mid-childhood and compare developmental and behavioral profiles at mid-childhood and 3 years in those with earlier versus later recognized autism, and those who had, or had not, received a community autism diagnosis. The autism recurrence rate in this sample in mid-childhood was 37.1%, 95% CI [29.9%, 44.9%] and higher in boys than girls. Around half of those diagnosed with autism in mid-childhood had not received a diagnosis at 3 years. Later, diagnosis was more common in girls than boys. While some had sub-threshold symptoms at 3, in others late diagnosis followed a largely typical early presentation. Sibling recurrence based on community clinical diagnosis was 24.5%, 95% CI [18.4%, 31.9%]. Those who also had a community diagnosis tended to be older, have lower adaptive function and higher autism and inattention symptoms. Notwithstanding limitations of a single site study, modest sample size and limits to generalisability, autism sibling recurrence in family history infants may be higher in mid-childhood than in studies reporting diagnostic outcome at 3 years. Findings have implications for families and clinical services, and for prospective family history studies.},

	Abstract = {The topology of the functional brain network has been associated with several neuropsychiatric conditions. However, little is known about its genetic underpinnings, and whether this overlaps with brain structure and neuropsychiatric conditions. Hence, we conducted genome-wide association study across six graph metrics of the macroscale functional networks at global, hemispheric and regional levels and their hemispheric asymmetry in 54,030 individuals. We identified seven experiment-wide significant loci and prioritised ten candidate genes. Both global graph metrics and hemispheric asymmetry are modestly heritable, but phenotypically and genetically form two clusters. Furthermore, cortical macro- and microstructure are causally related to global graph metrics and asymmetry, respectively, suggesting a dual structural constraint on functional network organisation. Finally, amongst twelve common neuropsychiatric conditions, only autism was genetically correlated with graph metrics of the functional network, supporting phenotypic case-control differences in functional connectivity. Overall, our results suggest different genetic axes shaping different aspects of brain functional topology and demonstrate shared biology with brain structure and autism.},

In both cohorts, maternal autistic traits were assessed using the short form of the Autism Spectrum Quotient, and information about maternal height and weight before pregnancy was obtained by questionnaire.

Furthermore, a higher maternal pre-pregnancy BMI was associated with higher child autistic traits, but only in Generation R (β<sub>adjusted</sub> = 0.03, p < 0.01). There was no significant moderating effect of maternal pre-pregnancy BMI on the association between autistic traits of mothers and children, neither in Generation R nor in CUSP. In addition, child autistic traits scores were significantly higher in mothers who were underweight and in mothers who were overweight compared to mothers with a healthy weight.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We confirm the association between maternal and child autistic traits in toddlerhood, early childhood, and early adolescence.

	Abstract = {<h4>ABSTRACT</h4> <h4>Introduction</h4> Autism is a common neurodevelopmental condition with a complex genetic aetiology that includes contributions from monogenic and polygenic factors. Many autistic people have unmet healthcare needs that could be served by genomics-informed research and clinical trials. The primary aim of the European Autism GEnomics Registry (EAGER) is to establish a registry of participants with a diagnosis of autism or an associated rare genetic condition who have undergone whole-genome sequencing. The registry can facilitate recruitment for future clinical trials and research studies, based on genetic, clinical, and phenotypic profiles, as well as participant preferences. The secondary aim of EAGER is to investigate the association between mental and physical health characteristics and participants’ genetic profiles. <h4>Methods and analysis</h4> EAGER is a European multisite cohort study and registry and is part of the AIMS-2-TRIALS consortium. EAGER was developed with input from the AIMS-2-TRIALS Autism Representatives and representatives from the rare genetic conditions community. 1,500 participants with a diagnosis of autism or an associated rare genetic condition will be recruited at 13 sites across 8 countries. Participants will give a blood or saliva sample for whole-genome sequencing and answer a series of online questionnaires. Participants may also consent for the study to access pre-existing clinical data. Participants will be added to the EAGER registry. Data will be shared via the Autism Sharing Initiative, a new international collaboration aiming to create a federated system for autism data sharing. <h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4> EAGER has received full ethical approval from ethics committees in the UK (REC 23/SC/0022), Germany (S-375/2023), Portugal (CE-085/2023) and Spain (HCB/2023/0038, PIC-164-22). Approvals are in the process of being obtained from committees in Italy, Sweden, Ireland, and France. Findings will be disseminated via scientific publications and conferences, but also beyond to participants and the wider community (e.g., the AIMS-2-TRIALS website, stakeholder meetings, newsletters). <h4>STRENGHTS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY</h4> Data from full genotyping through whole-genome sequencing will be combined with mental and physical health data and participant research priorities The EAGER sample (n=1,500), although relatively small for genetic analyses, will include a substantial proportion (around one third) of participants with a rare genetic condition, ensuring that heterogeneous presentations across the autism spectrum are captured The EAGER registry will improve the speed, efficiency, and impact of research studies and clinical trials across Europe with a culturally diverse cohort of re-contactable participants, and shared data through the Autism Sharing Initiative EAGER was developed with input from the AIMS-2-TRIALS Autism Representatives and representatives from the rare genetic conditions community Phenotypic data are collected only via self/informant-report questionnaires and not direct clinical assessments},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>There is considerable evidence reporting an excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) cortical imbalance in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, previous findings on the direction of this imbalance and its relationship to ASD symptomatology are heterogeneous. Some factors contributing to these mixed results might be the methodological differences between studies assessing the E/I ratio and the intrinsic variability within the autistic spectrum. Studying the evolution of ASD symptoms and the factors that modulate it might help to explain and reduce this variability. Here we present a study protocol to explore the longitudinal role of E/I imbalance in ASD symptoms, combining different approaches to measure the E/I ratio and using the trajectories of symptom severity as a framework.<h4>Methods</h4>This observational two time-point prospective study assesses the E/I ratio and the evolution of the behavioural symptoms in a sample of at least 98 participants with ASD. Participants are enrolled at 12 to 72 months of age and followed from 18 to 48 months after. A comprehensive battery of tests is applied to evaluate ASD clinical symptoms. The E/I ratio is approached from electrophysiology, magnetic resonance, and genetics. We will calculate the individual change for the main ASD symptoms and, based on that, we will define the trajectories of symptom severity. Then, we will investigate the correlation between measures of excitation/inhibition balance and autistic symptomatology cross-sectionally, as well as the ability of these measurements to predict changes in symptoms over time.<h4>Discussion</h4>This study presents a robust multisystemic approach to the E/I imbalance theory in autism and its relation to divergent symptom trajectories. That setting will allow us to relate and compare the neurobiological information coming from different sources and its impact on behavioural symptoms while accounting for the high variability in ASD. The findings derived from this study could contribute to the ASD biomarkers research and might provide valuable evidence for the development of more personalized treatments in ASD.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Many autistic children experience difficulties in their communication and language skills development, with consequences for social development into adulthood, often resulting in challenges over the life-course and high economic impacts for individuals, families, and society. The Preschool Autism Communication Trial (PACT) intervention is effective in terms of improved social communication and some secondary outcomes. A previously published within-trial economic analysis found that results at 13 months did not support its cost-effectiveness. We modeled cost-effectiveness over 6 years and across four European countries.<h4>Methods</h4>Using simulation modeling, we built on economic analyses in the original trial, exploring longer-term cost-effectiveness at 6 years (in England). We adapted our model to undertake an economic analysis of PACT in Ireland, Italy, and Spain. Data on resource use were taken from the original trial and a more recent Irish observational study.<h4>Results</h4>PACT is cost-saving over time from a societal perspective, even though we confirmed that, at 13 months post-delivery, PACT is more expensive than usual treatment (across all countries) when given to preschool autistic children. After 6 years, we found that PACT has lower costs than usual treatment in terms of unpaid care provided by parents (in all countries). Also, if we consider only out-of-pocket expenses from an Irish study, PACT costs less than usual treatment.<h4>Discussion</h4>PACT may be recommended as a cost-saving early intervention for families with an autistic child.},

We then looked at whether performance in autistic people differed to non-autistic people during a visual statistical learning task and specifically examined whether differences in performance between groups occurred when sequential information was presented at a semantic level. We did this by assessing recall performance using a two-alternative forced choice paradigm after presenting participants with a sequence of naturalistic scene images.<h4>Methods</h4>125 adult participants (61 participants with an autism diagnosis and 64 non-autistic controls) were presented with a fast serial presentation sequence of images and given a cover task to avoid attention being explicitly drawn to patterns in the underlying sequences. This was followed by a two-alternative forced choice task to assess participants' implicit recall. Participants were presented with 1 of 3 unique versions of the task, in which the presentation and assessment of statistical regularities was done at either a low feature-based level or a high semantic-based level.<h4>Results</h4>Participants were able to generalise statistical information from specific exemplars to semantically similar ones. There was an overall significant reduction in visual statistical learning in the autistic group but we were unable to determine whether group differences occurred specifically in conditions where the learning of semantic information was required.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These results provide evidence that participants are able to extract statistical information that is presented at the level of specific exemplars and generalise it to semantically similar contexts. We also showed a modest but statistically significant reduction in recall performance in the autistic participants relative to the non-autistic participants.},

	Abstract = {Developmental antecedents of autism may affect parent-infant interactions (PII), altering the context in which core social skills develop. While studies have identified differences in PII between infants with and without elevated likelihood (EL) for autism, samples have been small. Here, we examined whether previously reported differences are replicable. From a longitudinal study of 113 EL and 27 typical likelihood infants (TL), 6-min videotaped unstructured PII was blind rated at 8 and 14 months on eight interactional qualities. Autism outcome was assessed at 36 months. Linear mixed-effects models found higher parent sensitive responsiveness, nondirectiveness, and mutuality ratings in TL than EL infants with and without later autism. PII qualities at 8 (infant positive affect, parent directiveness) and 14 months (infant attentiveness to parent, mutuality) predicted 3-year autism. Attentiveness to parent decreased between 8 and 14 months in EL infants with later autism. This larger study supports previous findings of emerging alterations in PII in this group and extends on this by detecting earlier (8-month) predictive effects of PII for autism outcome and a more marked trajectory of decreased social attentiveness. The findings strengthen the evidence base to support the implementation of early preemptive interventions to support PII in infants with early autism signs.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background & aims</h4>Language abilities of autistic children and children at elevated likelihood for autism (EL-siblings) are highly heterogeneous, and many of them develop language deficits. It is as of yet unclear why language abilities of autistic children and EL-siblings vary, although an interaction of multiple influential factors is likely at play. In this review, we describe research articles that identify one or multiple of such factors associated with the receptive or expressive language abilities of autistic children and EL-siblings since the introduction of the <i>DSM-5</i>. Our aim was to identify and summarize factors that are linked to language development in autistic children and siblings in the recent literature to ultimately gain insight into the heterogeneity of language abilities in these children.<h4>Methods</h4>The search strategy of this review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The following databases were consulted: Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science Core Collection, and Scopus. Inclusion criteria for studies were the presence of a sample of autistic children no older than 7 years old who were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder per the criteria of the <i>DSM-5</i>. Intervention studies and studies without an explicitly reported language measure were excluded. Risk of bias assessment was completed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scales. Ultimately, 55 articles were included in this review.<h4>Main contribution</h4>Fifty-six factors were identified to be related to receptive or expressive language abilities of autistic children and EL-siblings. They were grouped into three main categories: biological factors; psychosocial and environmental factors; and age-related and developmental factors, each with different subcategories. Although many of the identified variables were only examined in one article, some well-researched associated factors were reported across multiple studies and were present in both autistic children and EL-siblings, in particular joint attention, nonverbal cognitive abilities and frontal EEG power. Better insight in these factors associated with language abilities in autistic children and siblings at elevated likelihood can inform future intervention strategies to reduce language deficits and its corresponding negative consequences in these children.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results confirm that multiple different factors likely underlie language deficits in autism. Important aspects that should be considered are, among others, social factors such as joint attention, child characteristics such as nonverbal cognition, and neurocognitive factors.},

	Abstract = {We developed a Dutch questionnaire called the Autistic Women's Experience (AWE) and compared its psychometric properties to the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ). Whilst attenuated gender differences on the AQ have been widely replicated, this instrument may not fully capture the unique experience of autistic women. The AWE was co-developed with autistic women to include items that reflect autistic women's experience. We investigated the AWE (49 items) and compared it with the AQ (50 items) in Dutch autistic individuals (<i>N</i> = 153, <i>n</i> = 85 women) and in the general population (<i>N</i> = 489, <i>n</i> = 246 women) aged 16+. Both the AQ and AWE had excellent internal consistency and were highly and equally predictive of autism in both women and men. Whilst there was a gender difference on the AQ among non-autistic people (men > women), there was no gender difference among autistic people, confirming all earlier studies. No gender differences were detected on the AWE overall scale, yet subtle gender differences were observed on the subscales. We conclude that the AQ is valid for both genders, but the AWE provides an additional useful perspective on the characteristics of autistic women. The AWE needs further validation in independent samples using techniques that allow for testing gender biases, as well as a confirmatory factor analysis in a larger sample.},

	Abstract = {Clinical trials of pharmacological candidates targeting the core features of autism have largely failed. This is despite evidence linking differences in multiple neurochemical systems to brain function in autism. While this has in part been explained by the heterogeneity of the autistic population, the field has largely relied upon association studies to link brain chemistry to function. The only way to directly establish that a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator is involved in a candidate brain function is to change it and observe a shift in that function. This experimental approach dominates preclinical neuroscience, but not human studies. There is little direct experimental evidence describing how neurochemical systems modulate information processing in the living human brain. Thus, our understanding of how neurochemical differences contribute to neurodiversity is limited, impeding our ability to translate findings from animal studies into humans. Here, we introduce our 'shiftability' paradigm, an approach to bridge the translational gap in autism research. We provide an overview of the guiding principles and methodologies we use to directly test the hypothesis that neurochemical systems function differently in autistic and non-autistic individuals.},

	Abstract = {Autism is a highly heritable, heterogeneous, neurodevelopmental condition. Large-scale genetic studies, predominantly focussing on simplex families and clinical diagnoses of autism have identified hundreds of genes associated with autism. Yet, the contribution of these classes of genes to multiplex families and autistic traits still warrants investigation. Here, we conducted whole-genome sequencing of 21 highly multiplex autism families, with at least three autistic individuals in each family, to prioritise genes associated with autism. Using a combination of both autistic traits and clinical diagnosis of autism, we identify rare variants in genes associated with autism, and related neurodevelopmental conditions in multiple families. We identify a modest excess of these variants in autistic individuals compared to individuals without an autism diagnosis. Finally, we identify a convergence of the genes identified in molecular pathways related to development and neurogenesis. In sum, our analysis provides initial evidence to demonstrate the value of integrating autism diagnosis and autistic traits to prioritise genes.},

We assessed eye movements in 450 twins (225 pairs, 57% monozygotic, 46% female, aged 5-6 months) using the gap-overlap eye-tracking task. Shorter latency in the gap condition was associated with having more parent-rated autistic traits at 2 years. Latency across the task's three conditions was primarily explained by one highly heritable latent factor likely representing individual differences in basic oculomotor efficiency and/or in visual information processing. Additionally, disengagement of attention was linked to unique genetic factors, suggesting that genetic factors involved in visual attention are different from those involved in basic visual information processing and oculomotor efficiency.},

	Abstract = {Up to 50% of autistic people experience co-occurring anxiety, which significantly impacts their quality of life. Consequently, developing new interventions (and/ or adapting existing ones) that improve anxiety has been indicated as a priority for clinical research and practice by the autistic community. Despite this, there are very few effective, evidence-based therapies available to autistic people that target anxiety; and those that are available (e.g., autism adapted Cognitive Behavioural Therapy; CBT) can be challenging to access. Thus, the current study will provide an early-stage proof of concept for the feasibility and acceptability of a novel app-based therapeutic approach that has been developed with, and adapted for, autistic people to support them in managing anxiety using UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommended adapted CBT approaches. This paper describes the design and methodology of an ethically approved (22/LO/0291) ongoing non-randomised pilot trial that aims to enrol approximately 100 participants aged ≥16-years with an existing autism diagnosis and mild-to-severe self-reported anxiety symptoms (trial registration NCT05302167). Participants will be invited to engage with a self-guided app-based intervention-'Molehill Mountain'. Primary (Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and secondary outcomes (medication/ service use and Goal Attainment Scaling) will be assessed at baseline (Week 2 +/- 2), endpoint (Week 15 +/- 2) and three follow-ups (Weeks 24, 32 and 41 +/- 4). Participants will also be invited to complete an app acceptability survey/ interview at the study endpoint. Analyses will address: 1) app acceptability/ useability and feasibility (via survey/ interview and app usage data); and 2) target population, performance of outcome measures and ideal timing/ duration of intervention (via primary/ secondary outcome measures and survey/ interview)-with both objectives further informed by a dedicated stakeholder advisory group. The evidence from this study will inform the future optimisation and implementation of Molehill Mountain in a randomised-controlled trial, to provide a novel tool that can be accessed easily by autistic adults and may improve mental health outcomes.},

	Abstract = {A large body of research showed that autistic people have intact emotional (affective) empathy alongside reduced cognitive empathy. However, there are mixed findings and these call for a more subtle understanding of empathy in autism. Empathic disequilibrium refers to the imbalance between emotional and cognitive empathy and is associated with a higher number of autistic traits in the typical population. Here we examined whether empathic disequilibrium predicts both the number of autistic traits and autism diagnosis. In a large sample of autistic (N = 1905) and typical individuals (N = 3009), we examined empathic disequilibrium and empathy as predictors of autistic traits and autism diagnosis, using a polynomial regression with response surface analysis. Empathy and autistic traits were measured using validated self-report questionnaires. Both empathic disequilibrium and empathy predicted linearly and non-linearly autism diagnosis and autistic traits. Specifically, a tendency towards higher emotional than cognitive empathy (empathic disequilibrium towards emotional empathy) predicted both autism diagnosis and the social domain of autistic traits, while higher cognitive than emotional empathy was associated with the non-social domain of autism. Empathic disequilibrium was also more prominent in autistic females. This study provides evidence that beyond empathy as was measured thus far, empathic disequilibrium offers a novel analytical approach for examining the role of empathy. Empathic disequilibrium allows for a more nuanced understanding of the links between empathy and autism. LAY SUMMARY: Many autistic individuals report feelings of excessive empathy, yet their experience is not reflected by most of the current literature, typically suggesting that autism is characterized by intact emotional and reduced cognitive empathy. To fill this gap, we looked at both ends of the imbalance between these components, termed empathic disequilibrium. We show that, like empathy, empathic disequilibrium is related to autism diagnosis and traits, and thus may provide a more nuanced understanding of empathy and its link with autism.},

	Abstract = {Mental health difficulties commonly co-occur with autism, especially in autistic people accessing clinic services, impacting substantially on quality-of-life. Alexithymia (difficulty describing/identifying feelings) and sensory processing differences are prevalent traits in autism that have been associated with depression/anxiety in autistic community samples. However, it is important to better understand interrelationships between these traits in clinical populations to improve identification of service-user needs. In this study, 190 autistic adults (65.3% male), seen in a tertiary autism clinic, completed self-report measures of alexithymia (20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale), sensory processing differences (Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile) and depression/anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). Multiple linear regression models and mediation analyses were used to examine associations between alexithymia, sensory processing differences, and depression/anxiety severity. Across the sample, 66.3% of individuals (<i>N</i> = 126) were classified as alexithymic (score ≥ 61). Total alexithymia and difficulty describing/identifying feelings were significantly associated with depression severity (β = 0.30-0.38, highest <i>p</i> < 0.002), and difficulty identifying feelings was significantly associated with anxiety severity (β = 0.36, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Sensory processing differences were also significantly associated with depression severity (β = 0.29, <i>p</i> = 0.002) and anxiety severity across all models (β = 0.34-0.48, highest <i>p</i> < 0.001) Finally, difficulty describing/identifying feelings partially mediated the relationships between sensory processing differences and both depression/anxiety severity. Overall, these results highlight that interventions adapted for and targeting emotional awareness and sensory-related uncertainty may improve mental health outcomes in autistic service-users.},

Cohorts of autistic children (n = 939; mean age = 7.35 years (SD = 2.15)) and autistic adults (n = 736; mean age = 37 years (SD = 12.39)) from the Cambridge Autism Research Database (CARD) were each divided into two groups: with or without siblings. Empathy was measured using the children version of the Empathy Quotient (EQ) (parent-report) for children. For adults, the EQ (self-report version) and the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) were used. Contrary to the hypothesis, autistic children without siblings scored higher on EQ than those with siblings (t<sub>(283.70)</sub> = 4.20, p < .001; d = 0.50). In adults, there was no difference between autistic adults with and without siblings on both measures, but there was an interaction effect between sex and group on the RMET (f<sub>(1732)</sub> = 4.10, p = 0.04): whilst autistic males without siblings on average scored lower than females, autistic males with siblings on average performed similarly to females. Future research should investigate the possible effect of siblings on autistic males' empathy performance in a larger cohort of autistic individuals. Children's empathic abilities may be underestimated by their parents when they have siblings due to a contrast effect.},

Despite overlapping presentation and sex-biased prevalence, autism and ADHD are rarely studied together, and sex differences are often overlooked. Normative modelling provides a unified framework for studying age-specific and sex-specific divergences in neurodivergent brain development. <h4>Methods</h4> Here we use normative modelling and a large, multi-site neuroimaging dataset to characterise cortical anatomy associated with autism and ADHD, benchmarked against models of typical brain development based on a sample of over 75,000 individuals. We also examined sex and age differences, relationship with autistic traits, and explored the co-occurrence of autism and ADHD (autism+ADHD). <h4>Results</h4> We observed robust neuroanatomical signatures of both autism and ADHD. Overall, autistic individuals showed greater cortical thickness and volume localised to the superior temporal cortex, whereas individuals with ADHD showed more global effects of cortical thickness increases but lower cortical volume and surface area across much of the cortex. The autism+ADHD group displayed a unique pattern of widespread increases in cortical thickness, and certain decreases in surface area. We also found evidence that sex modulates the neuroanatomy of autism but not ADHD, and an age-by-diagnosis interaction for ADHD only. <h4>Conclusions</h4> These results indicate distinct cortical differences in autism and ADHD that are differentially impacted by age, sex, and potentially unique patterns related to their co-occurrence.},

We used data from 536 toddlers from London (UK), collected at birth (gestational age at birth, sex, maternal body mass index, age, parental education, parental language, parental history of neurodevelopmental conditions) and at 18 months (parents cohabiting, measures of socio-economic deprivation, measures of maternal parenting style, and a measure of maternal depression). Autism traits were assessed using the Quantitative Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (Q-CHAT) at 18 months. A multivariable model explained 20% of Q-CHAT variance, with four individually significant variables (two measures of parenting style and two measures of socio-economic deprivation). In order to address variable collinearity we used principal component analysis, finding that a component which was positively correlated with Q-CHAT was also correlated to measures of parenting style and socio-economic deprivation. Our results show that parenting style and socio-economic deprivation correlate with the emergence of autism traits at age 18 months as measured with the Q-CHAT in a community sample.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Neurofibromatosis Type 1 is a genetic condition diagnosed in infancy that substantially increases the likelihood of a child experiencing cognitive and developmental difficulties, including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Children with NF1 show clear differences in attention, but whether these differences emerge in early development and how they relate to broader difficulties with cognitive and learning skills is unclear. To address this question requires longitudinal prospective studies from infancy, where the relation between domains of visual attention (including exogenous and endogenous shifting) and cognitive development can be mapped over time.<h4>Methods</h4>We report data from 28 infants with NF1 tested longitudinally at 5, 10 and 14 months compared to cohorts of 29 typical likelihood infants (with no history of NF1 or ASD and/or ADHD), and 123 infants with a family history of ASD and/or ADHD. We used an eyetracking battery to measure both exogenous and endogenous control of visual attention.<h4>Results</h4>Infants with NF1 demonstrated intact social orienting, but slower development of endogenous visual foraging. This slower development presented as prolonged engagement with a salient stimulus in a static display relative to typically developing infants. In terms of exogenous attention shifting, NF1 infants showed faster saccadic reaction times than typical likelihood infants. However, the NF1 group demonstrated a slower developmental improvement from 5 to 14 months of age. Individual differences in foraging and saccade times were concurrently related to visual reception abilities within the full infant cohort (NF1, typical likelihood and those with a family history of ASD/ADHD).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results provide preliminary evidence that alterations in saccadic reaction time and visual foraging may contribute to learning difficulties in infants with NF1.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Difficulties in social communication are a defining clinical feature of autism. However, the underlying neurobiological heterogeneity has impeded targeted therapies and requires new approaches to identifying clinically relevant bio-behavioural subgroups. In the largest autism cohort to date, we comprehensively examined difficulties in facial expression recognition, a key process in social communication, as a bio-behavioural stratification biomarker, and validated them against clinical features and neurofunctional responses.<h4>Methods</h4>Between 255 and 488 participants aged 6-30 years with autism, typical development and/or mild intellectual disability completed the Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces task, the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task and/or the Films Expression Task. We first examined mean-group differences on each test. Then, we used a novel intersection approach that compares two centroid and connectivity-based clustering methods to derive subgroups based on the combined performance across the three tasks. Measures and subgroups were then related to clinical features and neurofunctional differences measured using fMRI during a fearful face-matching task.<h4>Results</h4>We found significant mean-group differences on each expression recognition test. However, cluster analyses showed that these were driven by a low-performing autistic subgroup (~ 30% of autistic individuals who performed below 2SDs of the neurotypical mean on at least one test), while a larger subgroup (~ 70%) performed within 1SD on at least 2 tests. The low-performing subgroup also had on average significantly more social communication difficulties and lower activation in the amygdala and fusiform gyrus than the high-performing subgroup.<h4>Limitations</h4>Findings of autism expression recognition subgroups and their characteristics require independent replication. This is currently not possible, as there is no other existing dataset that includes all relevant measures. However, we demonstrated high internal robustness (91.6%) of findings between two clustering methods with fundamentally different assumptions, which is a critical pre-condition for independent replication.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We identified a subgroup of autistic individuals with expression recognition difficulties and showed that this related to clinical and neurobiological characteristics. If replicated, expression recognition may serve as bio-behavioural stratification biomarker and aid in the development of targeted interventions for a subgroup of autistic individuals.},

Of these, 97 had data from 2 timepoints resulting in a total scan number of 466. Grey matter density maps, probabilistic tractography connectivity matrices and connectopic maps were extracted from respective MRI modalities and were then integrated with Linked Independent Component Analysis. Linear mixed-effects models were used to evaluate the relationship between components and group while accounting for covariates and non-independence of participants with longitudinal data. Additional models were run to investigate associations with dimensional measures of behaviour. We identified one component that differed significantly between groups (coefficient = 0.33, p adj = 0.02). This was driven (99%) by variance of the right fusiform gyrus connectopic map 2. While there were multiple nominal associations with behavioural measures, none were significant following multiple comparison correction. Our analysis considered the relative contributions of both structural and functional brain phenotypes simultaneously, finding that functional phenotypes drive associations with autism. These findings expanded on previous unimodal studies by revealing the topographic organisation of functional connectivity patterns specific to autism and warrant further investigation.},

	Abstract = {Brain function is the dynamic output of coordinated excitatory and inhibitory (E-I) activity. E-I alterations, arising from differences in excitatory glutamate and inhibitory GABA pathways, are implicated in the development and heterogeneity of multiple neurodevelopmental conditions, such as autism; and are consequently targets for pharmacological support options. Yet, E-I measures of neurotransmitter levels or receptors in the living human brain (such as Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy or Positron Emission Tomography) are expensive and/or invasive and do not capture dynamics. The determine if a candidate metric captures a neurosignalling system, the system must be challenged and changes observed objectively. This is basis of animal study designs. The aperiodic 1/f exponent of the EEG power spectrum is sensitive to E-I perturbations in animals but, more work is needed to translate to humans. Therefore, we tested the hypotheses that i) the aperiodic 1/f exponent of resting-state EEG in humans changes following a pharmacological E-I challenge with arbaclofen, a GABA B receptor agonist; and ii) dynamic responsivity to GABAergic challenge is different in a neurodevelopmental condition associated with E-I differences, namely autism. As predicted, in both groups the aperiodic 1/f exponent significantly increased following a high (30mg) dose of arbaclofen. However, an aperiodic exponent increase was also elicited at a lower (15mg) dose of arbaclofen in autistic but not non-autistic individuals. Hence, in humans, the aperiodic 1/f exponent captures E-I dynamics and autistic brains are dynamically different compared to non-autistic brains. We suggest that our results can be explained by homeostatic differences E-I regulation between groups.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Alterations in the serotonergic control of brain pathways responsible for facial emotion processing in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may be a target for intervention. However, the molecular underpinnings of autistic-neurotypical serotonergic differences are challenging to access in vivo. Receptor-Enriched Analysis of functional Connectivity by Targets (REACT) has helped define molecular-enriched functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain networks based on a priori information about the spatial distribution of neurochemical systems from available PET templates.<h4>Methods</h4>We used REACT to estimate the dominant fMRI signal related to the serotonin (5-HT) transporter (SERT) distribution during processing of aversive facial emotion in adults with and without ASD. We first predicted a group difference in baseline (placebo) functioning of this system. We next used a single 20 mg oral dose of citalopram, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, to test the hypothesis that network activity in people with and without ASD would respond differently to inhibition of SERT. To confirm the specificity of our findings, we also repeated the analysis with 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A and 5-HT4 receptor maps.<h4>Results</h4>Using REACT with the SERT map, we found a baseline group difference in the SERT-enriched response to faces in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. A single oral dose of citalopram 'shifted' the response in the ASD group towards the neurotypical baseline but did not alter response in the control group. Similar differences in SERT-enriched response were observed after controlling for other 5-HT maps.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings suggest that the SERT-enriched functional network is dynamically different in ASD during processing of socially relevant stimuli. Whether this acute neurobiological response to citalopram in ASD translates to a clinical target will be an important next step.},

	Abstract = {Suppressing responses to repetitive sounds, while staying vigilant to rare sounds, is a cross-species trait vital for survival, which is altered in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Preclinical models implicate ϒ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in this process. Although differences in GABA genes, post-mortem markers and bulk tissue GABA levels have been observed in ASD, the link between GABA and auditory processing in humans (with or without ASD) is largely correlational. Here, we directly evaluated the role of GABA in auditory repetition suppression in 66 adults (n = 28 with ASD). Neurophysiological responses (temporal and frequency domains) to repetitive standard tones and novel deviants presented in an oddball paradigm were compared after double-blind, randomized administration of placebo, 15 or 30 mg of arbaclofen (STX209), a GABA type B (GABA B ) receptor agonist. We first established that temporal mismatch negativity was comparable between control participants and those with ASD. Next, we showed that temporal and spectral responses to repetitive standards were suppressed relative to responses to deviants in the two groups, but suppression was significantly weaker in individuals with ASD at baseline. Arbaclofen reversed weaker suppression of spectral responses in ASD but disrupted suppression in controls. An individual ‘sensitivity index’ of arbaclofen-elicited shift in suppression strongly correlated with autistic symptomatology measured using the Autism Quotient. Thus, our results confirm: GABAergic dysfunction is fundamental to the neurophysiology of auditory sensory processing alterations in ASD, which can be modulated by targeting GABA B activity; and these GABA-dependent sensory differences may be upstream of more complex autistic phenotypes. <h4>One Sentence Summary</h4> Differences in GABAergic function are fundamental to autistic (auditory) sensory neurobiology; but are modulated by targeting GABA B .},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>The poorer physical health of autistic adults compared to non-autistic adults has been highlighted by several epidemiological studies. However, research has so far been limited to specific geographical areas and has primarily focused on young autistic individuals (aged 35 years and younger). Recent studies indicate a higher rate of mortality in autistic people, as well as poorer quality of self-reported healthcare interactions. This study aims to determine, first, whether autistic people experience greater levels of non-communicable health conditions and second, whether these are explained by differences in demographics (i.e. sex, country of residence, ethnicity, education level), alcohol use, smoking, body mass index (BMI), or family history of medical conditions.<h4>Method</h4>We employed a cross-sectional, convenience-sampling study via an anonymous, online survey of autistic and non-autistic adults (n = 2305, mean age = 41.6, 65.9% female, 49% autistic). The survey asked participants to self-report information about their demographics, autism diagnosis, diet, exercise, sleep, sexual health, substance use, personal medical history, and family medical history (for all first-degree, biological relatives). Binomial logistic regression across four iterative models of increasing complexity was applied to assess rates of physical health conditions. The Benjamini-Hochberg correction was used to account for multiple testing, and only physical health conditions that achieved at least 1% endorsement within the overall sample (n > 22) were included in the analysis to reduce risk of Type I errors. We also used novel network analysis methods to test whether there are increased levels of multimorbidity between autistic and non-autistic people.<h4>Results</h4>There were significantly elevated rates of non-communicable conditions across all organ systems in autistic people, including gastrointestinal, neurological, endocrine, visual, ear/nose/throat, skin, liver and kidney, and haematological conditions. We confirmed previous findings by showing highly significant differences in rates of neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms (p < 0.0001). In addition, we established in the largest sample to date that Ehler-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) was more likely to occur among autistic females compared to non-autistic females. Finally, we found a higher prevalence of Coeliac's disease among autistic individuals compared to non-autistic individuals after controlling for sex, ethnicity, country of residence, alcohol use, smoking, and BMI, but these results became non-significant after accounting for family history.<h4>Limitations</h4>Our study is biased towards females, white individuals, highly educated people, and UK residents, likely due to sampling biases. Our self-report study design may also exclude those who lack access to computers, or those with intellectual disability. Our network analysis is also limited in size.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study provides evidence of widespread, physical health comorbidity that spans nearly all major organ systems in autistic adults compared to non-autistic adults, using both binary logistic regression and network models. Healthcare professionals must be made aware of the range of co-occurring physical health conditions that may be more common among autistic people. However, our findings also point towards potential avenues requiring further exploration, such as the association of autism with both Coeliac's disease and EDS.},

For England and Spain, oxcarbazepine is the most cost-effective treatment when taken as additional treatment for those children whose response to monotherapy is suboptimal. In Ireland and Italy, gabapentin is the most cost-effective option. Our additional scenario analysis presents the aggregate cost to families with autistic children who are being treated for epilepsy: this cost is considerably higher than healthcare provider expenditure.},

Each episode contains a story depicting social interactions between characters in the form of a vehicle, with human faces grafted on to each of them. Each episode teaches a specific emotion in a story context. Autistic children watched at least three episodes at home for about 15 min daily for a month, with parental guidance. Its automated, home-based format is cost-saving and readily accessible. This study translated <i>The Transporters</i> to a Cantonese-Chinese version. Results showed a significant improvement in emotion recognition following viewing <i>The Transporters</i> in a group of Hong Kong Chinese autistic children, between 4 and 6 years of age, with and without attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (<i>n</i> = 48) relative to a control group (<i>n</i> = 24). A non-autistic group (<i>n</i> = 23) showed that the autistic children scored lower in emotion recognition pre-intervention. Post-intervention, the autistic children had improved in emotion recognition to the level of the non-autistic children. The autistic children in the intervention groups also generalized their learning to novel situations/characters not taught within <i>The Transporters</i>. There was no dosage effect, with the standard recommended number of episodes viewed being sufficient to achieve significant improvement. This study confirms the effectiveness of <i>The Transporters</i> for Chinese autistic children and contributes to the literature/practice by expanding the range of applicability of <i>The Transporters</i> to autistic children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, which is important given the high rate of co-occurrence between autism and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.},

We studied language and motor development using standardized observational and parent-report measures in infants with (n = 271) and without (n = 137) a family history of autism across four waves of data collection from 10 to 36 months. We used Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Models to examine contemporaneous and longitudinal associations between language and motor developments in both elevated and typical likelihood groups. We estimated paths between language and motor abilities at 10, 14, 24, and 36 months and autism trait scores at 36 months, to test whether the domains were interrelated and how they related to emerging autism traits. Results revealed consistent bidirectional Expressive Language (EL) and Fine Motor (FM) cross-lagged effects from 10 to 24 and a unidirectional EL to FM effect from 24 to 36 months as well as significantly correlated random intercepts between Gross motor (GM) and Receptive language (RL), indicating stable concurrent associations over time. However, only the associations between GM and RL were associated with later autism traits. Early motor and language are linked, but only gross motor and receptive language are jointly associated with autistic traits in infants with an autism family history.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background: </h4> There is considerable evidence reporting an excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) cortical imbalance in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, previous findings on the direction of this imbalance and its relationship to ASD symptomatology are heterogeneous. Some factors contributing to these mixed results might be the methodological differences between studies assessing the E/I ratio and the intrinsic variability within the autistic spectrum. Studying the evolution of ASD symptoms and the factors that modulate it might help to explain and reduce this variability. Here we present a study protocol to explore the longitudinal role of E/I imbalance in ASD symptoms, combining different approaches to measure the E/I ratio and using the trajectories of symptom severity as a framework. Methods. This observational two time-point prospective study assesses the E/I ratio and the evolution of the behavioural symptoms in a sample of at least 98 participants with ASD. Participants are enrolled at 12 to 72 months of age and followed from 18 to 48 months after. A comprehensive battery of tests is applied to evaluate ASD clinical symptoms. The E/I ratio is approached from electrophysiology, magnetic resonance, and genetics. We will calculate the individual change for the main ASD symptoms and, based on that, we will define the trajectories of symptom severity. Then, we will investigate the correlation between measures of excitation/inhibition balance and autistic symptomatology cross-sectionally, as well as the ability of these measurements to predict changes in symptoms over time. Discussion. This study presents a robust multisystemic approach to the E/I imbalance theory in autism and its relation to divergent symptom trajectories. That setting will allow us to relate and compare the neurobiological information coming from different sources and its impact on behavioural symptoms while accounting for the high variability in ASD. The findings derived from this study could contribute to the ASD biomarkers research and might provide valuable evidence for the development of more personalized treatments in ASD.},

We formed factors of Day and Night Sleep from parent-reported measures (including day/night sleep duration, number of naps in the day, frequency of night awakenings and sleep onset problems). We examined sleep in 164 infants at 5-, 10- and 14-months with/without a first-degree relative with ASD and/or ADHD who underwent a consensus clinical assessment for ASD at age 3.<h4>Results</h4>By 14-months, infants with a first-degree relative with ASD (but not ADHD) showed lower Night Sleep scores than infants with no family history of ASD; lower Night Sleep scores in infancy were also associated with a later ASD diagnosis, decreased cognitive ability, increased ASD symptomatology at 3-years, and developing social attention (e.g., looking to faces). We found no such effects with Day Sleep.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Sleep disturbances may be apparent at night from 14-months in infants with a family history of ASD and also those with later ASD, but were not associated with a family history of ADHD. Infant sleep disturbances were also linked to later dimensional variation in cognitive and social skills across the cohort. Night Sleep and Social Attention were interrelated over the first 2 years of life, suggesting that this may be one mechanism through which sleep quality influences neurodevelopment. Interventions targeted towards supporting families with their infant's sleep problems may be useful in this population.},

	Abstract = {Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (henceforth referred to as autism) display significant variation in clinical outcome. For instance, across age, some individuals' adaptive skills naturally improve or remain stable, while others' decrease. To pave the way for 'precision-medicine' approaches, it is crucial to identify the cross-sectional and, given the developmental nature of autism, longitudinal neurobiological (including neuroanatomical and linked genetic) correlates of this variation. We conducted a longitudinal follow-up study of 333 individuals (161 autistic and 172 neurotypical individuals, aged 6-30 years), with two assessment time points separated by ~12-24 months. We collected behavioural (Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scale-II, VABS-II) and neuroanatomical (structural magnetic resonance imaging) data. Autistic participants were grouped into clinically meaningful "Increasers", "No-changers", and "Decreasers" in adaptive behaviour (based on VABS-II scores). We compared each clinical subgroup's neuroanatomy (surface area and cortical thickness at T1, ∆T (intra-individual change) and T2) to that of the neurotypicals. Next, we explored the neuroanatomical differences' potential genomic associates using the Allen Human Brain Atlas. Clinical subgroups had distinct neuroanatomical profiles in surface area and cortical thickness at baseline, neuroanatomical development, and follow-up. These profiles were enriched for genes previously associated with autism and for genes previously linked to neurobiological pathways implicated in autism (e.g. excitation-inhibition systems). Our findings suggest that distinct clinical outcomes (i.e. intra-individual change in clinical profiles) linked to autism core symptoms are associated with atypical cross-sectional and longitudinal, i.e. developmental, neurobiological profiles. If validated, our findings may advance the development of interventions, e.g. targeting mechanisms linked to relatively poorer outcomes.},

	Abstract = {The excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) imbalance hypothesis posits that imbalance between excitatory (glutamatergic) and inhibitory (GABAergic) mechanisms underlies the behavioral characteristics of autism. However, how E/I imbalance arises and how it may differ across autism symptomatology and brain regions is not well understood. We used innovative analysis methods-combining competitive gene-set analysis and gene-expression profiles in relation to cortical thickness (CT) to investigate relationships between genetic variance, brain structure and autism symptomatology of participants from the AIMS-2-TRIALS LEAP cohort (autism = 359, male/female = 258/101; neurotypical control participants = 279, male/female = 178/101) aged 6-30 years. Using competitive gene-set analyses, we investigated whether aggregated genetic variation in glutamate and GABA gene-sets could be associated with behavioral measures of autism symptoms and brain structural variation. Further, using the same gene-sets, we corelated expression profiles throughout the cortex with differences in CT between autistic and neurotypical control participants, as well as in separate sensory subgroups. The glutamate gene-set was associated with all autism symptom severity scores on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2 (ADOS-2) and the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) within the autistic group. In adolescents and adults, brain regions with greater gene-expression of glutamate and GABA genes showed greater differences in CT between autistic and neurotypical control participants although in opposing directions. Additionally, the gene expression profiles were associated with CT profiles in separate sensory subgroups. Our results suggest complex relationships between E/I related genetics and autism symptom profiles as well as brain structure alterations, where there may be differential roles for glutamate and GABA.},

	Abstract = {Autism presents with significant phenotypic and neuroanatomical heterogeneity, and neuroimaging studies of the thalamus, globus pallidus and striatum in autism have produced inconsistent and contradictory results. These structures are critical mediators of functions known to be atypical in autism, including sensory gating and motor function. We examined both volumetric and fine-grained localized shape differences in autism using a large ( n =3145, 1045-1318 after strict quality control), cross-sectional dataset of T1-weighted structural MRI scans from 32 sites, including both males and females (assigned-at-birth). We investigated three potentially important sources of neuroanatomical heterogeneity: sex, age, and intelligence quotient (IQ), using a meta-analytic technique after strict quality control to minimize non-biological sources of variation. We observed no volumetric differences in the thalamus, globus pallidus, or striatum in autism. Rather, we identified a variety of localized shape differences in all three structures. Including age, but not sex or IQ, in the statistical model improved the fit for both the pallidum and striatum, but not for the thalamus. Age-centered shape analysis indicated a variety of age-dependent regional differences. Overall, our findings help confirm that the neurodevelopment of the striatum, globus pallidus and thalamus are atypical in autism, in a subtle location-dependent manner that is not reflected in overall structure volumes, and that is highly non-uniform across the lifespan.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Levels of steroid hormones in the first three months of life, a period referred to as 'mini-puberty', are one of the earliest physiological differences between typical males and females postnatally. Autistic traits also show consistent typical sex differences in later infancy, after the 18<sup>th</sup> month of life. Previous studies have shown <i>prenatal</i> testosterone is associated with later levels of autistic traits. Studies testing if postnatal testosterone levels are associated with autistic traits have reported null results. No studies to date have investigated mini-puberty longitudinally or tested for interactions with baseline sex differences or familial likelihood of autism.<h4>Methods</h4>The 'Cambridge Human Imaging and Longitudinal Development Study' (CHILD) is a prospective enriched cohort study in Cambridge, UK. It includes physiological measurements in early infancy, as well as neurodevelopmental follow-ups over the first two years of life. A subset of the cohort also includes children with a family history of autism (a diagnosed parent or sibling). Salivary testosterone levels were assessed at two time-points, just after the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> month of life. Autistic traits were measured using the Quantitative Checklist of Autism in Toddlers (Q-CHAT) when the children were 18 months of age.<h4>Results</h4>Salivary testosterone levels were significantly higher during 'mini-puberty' in the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> month of life, compared to after the 6<sup>th</sup> month of life, in both males and females. There was no significant sex difference at either time-point. Log-transformed testosterone levels were not associated with autistic traits (Q-CHAT). There was no interaction effect with infant sex, autism family history or baseline testosterone levels after mini-puberty (at >6 months of age).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Both male and female infants have elevated levels of salivary testosterone during mini-puberty but in this relatively small sample this was not associated with their later autistic traits at 18 months or their family history of autism. This suggests that <i>prenatal</i> rather than postnatal testosterone levels are more relevant for understanding the causes of autism. Future studies should test these relationships in larger samples.},

	Abstract = {The human thalamus is an integrative hub for multiple cortical and subcortical circuits involved in both sensory processing and higher cognitive functions. Group-level thalamic volume differences have been reported for multiple psychiatric and neurological disorders, but previous studies have relied on small samples, covered few disorders, or only investigated the whole thalamus without considering subdivisions. In this multi-site study, we compared thalamic nuclei volumes across several psychiatric and neurological disorders (N = 5 094) and healthy controls (N = 4 552). Using structural MRI scans, we segmented 25 bilateral thalamic nuclei, corresponding to six anatomical groups. We included patients covering 11 clinical conditions including mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia (DEM), major depressive disorder, schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SCZ), clinical high risk for schizophrenia, bipolar spectrum disorder, autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Parkinson’s disease, and multiple sclerosis (MS). Linear models revealed that some regions of the thalamus were significantly smaller in several conditions, with largest effects observed for MCI, DEM, SCZ and MS. The thalamic nuclei groups most affected across conditions were the medial and lateral thalamic groups, while the ventral and intralaminar groups were relatively spared. This pattern of effects largely corresponds with the canonical functional subdivision of the thalamus into higher-order and sensory thalamus. Clinical conditions differed when looking at the level of individual nuclei. The results highlight a role for the higher-order thalamus in common brain disorders and a differential involvement at the level of individual nuclei, contributing towards a mechanistic understanding of pathophysiological alteration in the thalamus.},

	Abstract = {The Shank3 gene encodes the major postsynaptic scaffolding protein SHANK3. Its mutation causes a syndromic form of autism spectrum disorder (ASD): Phelan-McDermid Syndrome (PMDS). It is characterized by global developmental delay, intellectual disorders (ID), ASD behavior, affective symptoms, as well as extra-cerebral symptoms. Although Shank3 deficiency causes a variety of molecular alterations, they do not suffice to explain all clinical aspects of this heterogenic syndrome. Since global gene expression alterations in Shank3 deficiency remain inadequately studied, we explored the transcriptome in vitro in primary hippocampal cells from Shank3∆11(-/-) mice, under control and lithium (Li) treatment conditions, and confirmed the findings in vivo. The Shank3∆11(-/-) genotype affected the overall transcriptome. Remarkably, extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell cycle transcriptional programs were disrupted. Accordingly, in the hippocampi of adolescent Shank3∆11(-/-) mice we found proteins of the collagen family and core cell cycle proteins downregulated. In vitro Li treatment of Shank3∆11(-/-) cells had a rescue-like effect on the ECM and cell cycle gene sets. Reversed ECM gene sets were part of a network, regulated by common transcription factors (TF) such as cAMP responsive element binding protein 1 (CREB1) and β-Catenin (CTNNB1), which are known downstream effectors of synaptic activity and targets of Li. These TFs were less abundant and/or hypo-phosphorylated in hippocampi of Shank3∆11(-/-) mice and could be rescued with Li in vitro and in vivo. Our investigations suggest the ECM compartment and cell cycle genes as new players in the pathophysiology of Shank3 deficiency, and imply involvement of transcriptional regulators, which can be modulated by Li. This work supports Li as potential drug in the management of PMDS symptoms, where a Phase III study is ongoing.},

Known causes of ASD are mutations of certain risk genes like the postsynaptic protein SHANK3 and environmental factors including prenatal infections.<h4>Methods</h4>To analyze the gene-environment interplay in ASD, we combined the Shank3Δ11-/- ASD mouse model with maternal immune activation (MIA) via an intraperitoneal injection of polyinosinic/polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C) on gestational day 12.5. The offspring of the injected dams was further analyzed for autistic-like behaviors and comorbidities followed by biochemical experiments with a focus on synaptic analysis.<h4>Results</h4>We show that the two-hit mice exhibit excessive grooming and deficits in social behavior more prominently than the Shank3Δ11-/- mice. Interestingly, these behavioral changes were accompanied by an unexpected upregulation of postsynaptic density (PSD) proteins at excitatory synapses in striatum, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.<h4>Limitations</h4>We found several PSD proteins to be increased in the two-hit mice; however, we can only speculate about possible pathways behind the worsening of the autistic phenotype in those mice.<h4>Conclusions</h4>With this study, we demonstrate that there is an interplay between genetic susceptibility and environmental factors defining the severity of ASD symptoms. Moreover, we show that a general misbalance of PSD proteins at excitatory synapses is linked to ASD symptoms, making this two-hit model a promising tool for the investigation of the complex pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders.},

	Abstract = {Genetic variants linked to autism are thought to change cognition and behaviour by altering the structure and function of the brain. Although a substantial body of literature has identified structural brain differences in autism, it is unknown whether autism-associated common genetic variants are linked to changes in cortical macro- and micro-structure. We investigated this using neuroimaging and genetic data from adults (UK Biobank, N = 31,748) and children (ABCD, N = 4,928). Using polygenic scores and genetic correlations we observe a robust negative association between common variants for autism and a magnetic resonance imaging derived phenotype for neurite density (intracellular volume fraction) in the general population. This result is consistent across both children and adults, in both the cortex and in white matter tracts, and confirmed using polygenic scores and genetic correlations. There were no sex differences in this association. Mendelian randomisation analyses provide no evidence for a causal relationship between autism and intracellular volume fraction, although this should be revisited using better powered instruments. Overall, this study provides evidence for shared common variant genetics between autism and cortical neurite density.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Attenuated social attention is a key marker of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Recent neuroimaging findings also emphasize an altered processing of sensory salience in ASD. The locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system (LC-NE) has been established as a modulator of this sensory salience processing (SSP). We tested the hypothesis that altered LC-NE functioning contributes to different SSP and results in diverging social attention in ASD.<h4>Methods</h4>We analyzed the baseline eye-tracking data of the EU-AIMS Longitudinal European Autism Project (LEAP) for subgroups of autistic participants (n = 166, age = 6-30 years, IQ = 61-138, gender [female/male] = 41/125) or neurotypical development (TD; n = 166, age = 6-30 years, IQ = 63-138, gender [female/male] = 49/117) that were matched for demographic variables and data quality. Participants watched brief movie scenes (k = 85) depicting humans in social situations (human) or without humans (non-human). SSP was estimated by gazes on physical and motion salience and a corresponding pupillary response that indexes phasic activity of the LC-NE. Social attention is estimated by gazes on faces via manual areas of interest definition. SSP is compared between groups and related to social attention by linear mixed models that consider temporal dynamics within scenes. Models are controlled for comorbid psychopathology, gaze behavior, and luminance.<h4>Results</h4>We found no group differences in gazes on salience, whereas pupillary responses were associated with altered gazes on physical and motion salience. In ASD compared to TD, we observed pupillary responses that were higher for non-human scenes and lower for human scenes. In ASD, we observed lower gazes on faces across the duration of the scenes. Crucially, this different social attention was influenced by gazes on physical salience and moderated by pupillary responses.<h4>Limitations</h4>The naturalistic study design precluded experimental manipulations and stimulus control, while effect sizes were small to moderate. Covariate effects of age and IQ indicate that the findings differ between age and developmental subgroups.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Pupillary responses as a proxy of LC-NE phasic activity during visual attention are suggested to modulate sensory salience processing and contribute to attenuated social attention in ASD.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Most research on early outcomes in infants with a family history (FH) of autism has focussed on categorically defined autism, although some have language and developmental delays. Less is known about outcomes in infants with a FH of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).<h4>Methods</h4>Infants with and without a FH of autism and/or ADHD, due to a first-degree relative with either or both conditions, were recruited at 5 or 10 months. Three year outcomes were characterised using latent profile analysis (LPA) across measures of cognitive ability, adaptive functioning and autism, ADHD and anxiety traits (<i>n</i> = 131). We additionally ran an LPA using only autism and ADHD measures, and the broader LPA in an independent cohort (<i>n</i> = 139) and in both cohorts combined (<i>n</i> = 270).<h4>Results</h4>A Low Developmental Level + High Behavioural Concerns class had elevated autism, ADHD and anxiety scores, low cognitive and adaptive function, and included all but one child with autism. A Low Developmental Level + Typical Behaviour class had average cognitive ability and typical behaviour but low adaptive function. A Typical Developmental Level + Some Behavioural Concerns class had average cognitive and adaptive function but slightly elevated behaviour scores. A High Developmental Level + Typical Behaviour class had above average cognitive ability and typical behaviour. All four LPAs identified classes characterised by combinations of either, or both, Low Development Level and elevated behaviour scores, as well as a typically developing class. No classes had elevated autism or ADHD traits in isolation.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Some infants with a FH of autism or ADHD have atypical developmental and behavioural outcomes, but do not show strong autism or ADHD traits in isolation. The field needs to recalibrate aims and methods to embrace the broader transdiagnostic pattern of outcomes seen in these infants.},

Disruption of large-scale functional connectivity in 22q11 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) has been widely reported, but the biological factors driving these changes remain unclear. We used a cross-species design to uncover the developmental trajectory and neural underpinnings of brain dysconnectivity in 22q11DS. In LgDel mice, a model for 22q11DS, we found age-specific patterns of brain dysconnectivity, with widespread fMRI hyperconnectivity in juvenile mice reconfiguring to hippocampal hypoconnectivity over puberty. These changes correlated with developmental alterations in dendritic spine density, and both were transiently normalized by GSK3β inhibition, suggesting a synaptic origin for this phenomenon. Notably, analogous pubertal hyperconnectivity-to-hypoconnectivity reconfiguration occurs in human 22q11DS, affecting cortical regions enriched for GSK3β-associated synaptic genes and autism-relevant transcripts. This dysconnectivity also predicts age-dependent social alterations in 22q11DS individuals. These results suggest that synaptic mechanisms underlie developmental brain dysconnectivity in 22q11DS.},

	Abstract = {We investigate whether autistic people's vulnerability is taken into account at each stage of the criminal justice system (CJS). Defense lawyers from 12 nations were included in the study although the sample was predominantly from the UK. Lawyers completed an online survey regarding one case in which they had defended an autistic client between January 2015 and January 2020; and on one case in which they had defended a nonautistic client charged with a similar offense, to provide a comparison group. Ninety-three lawyers (85% in the UK) reported on one autistic case, and 53 also reported on one nonautistic case. 75% of autistic clients were not given reasonable adjustments during the process. Only 43% were offered an appropriate adult during police investigations, even though they had an existing diagnosis of autism. 59% of prosecution barristers and 46% of judges said or did something during the trial that made the lawyers concerned that they did not have an adequate understanding of autism. Lawyers were 7.58 times more likely to be concerned about their autistic client's effective participation in court and were 3.83 times more likely to be concerned that their autistic clients would engage in self-harm, compared with their nonautistic clients. There is a failure to identify and address autistic peoples' disability within the CJS. There is a need for mandatory autism training for police officers and the judiciary, with a focus on identifying autism and understanding the needs of autistic people so that reasonable adjustments are offered in all cases. LAY SUMMARY: This study sought to investigate if the needs of autistic people are being overlooked by the police and other professionals within the CJS. Results show that autistic people are not always given the support they need during police questioning or in court. The experience of being involved with the police may also have a more negative impact on autistic peoples' mental health than that of nonautistic people.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Social attention affords learning opportunities across development and may contribute to individual differences in developmental trajectories, such as between male and female individuals, and in neurodevelopmental conditions, such as autism.<h4>Methods</h4>Using eye-tracking, we measured social attention in a large cohort of autistic (n = 123) and nonautistic females (n = 107), and autistic (n = 330) and nonautistic males (n = 204), aged 6-30 years. Using mixed Growth Curve Analysis, we modelled sex and diagnostic effects on the temporal dynamics of proportional looking time to three types of social stimuli (lean-static, naturalistic-static, and naturalistic-dynamic) and examined the link between individual differences and dimensional social and nonsocial autistic traits in autistic females and males.<h4>Results</h4>In the lean-static stimulus, average face-looking was higher in females than in males of both autistic and nonautistic groups. Differences in the dynamic pattern of face-looking were seen in autistic vs. nonautistic females, but not males, with face-looking peaking later in the trial in autistic females. In the naturalistic-dynamic stimulus, average face-looking was higher in females than in males of both groups; changes in the dynamic pattern of face looking were seen in autistic vs. nonautistic males, but not in females, with a steeper peak in nonautistic males. Lower average face-looking was associated with higher observer-measured autistic characteristics in autistic females, but not in males.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Overall, we found stronger social attention in females to a similar degree in both autistic and nonautistic groups. Nonetheless, the dynamic profiles of social attention differed in different ways in autistic females and males compared to their nonautistic peers, and autistic traits predicted trends of average face-looking in autistic females. These findings support the role of social attention in the emergence of sex-related differences in autistic characteristics, suggesting an avenue to phenotypic stratification.},

	Abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), or autism, is characterized by social and non-social symptoms, including sensory hyper- and hyposensitivities. A suggestion has been put forward that some of these symptoms could be explained by differences in how sensory information is integrated with its context, including a lower tendency to leverage the past in the processing of new perceptual input. At least two history-dependent effects of opposite directions have been described in the visual perception literature: a repulsive adaptation effect, where perception of a stimulus is biased away from an adaptor stimulus, and an attractive serial choice bias, where perceptual choices are biased toward the previous choice. In this study, we investigated whether autistic participants differed in either bias from typically developing controls (TDs). Sixty-four adolescent participants (31 with ASD, 33 TDs) were asked to categorize oriented line stimuli in two tasks that were designed so that we would induce either adaptation or serial choice bias. Although our tasks successfully induced both biases, in comparing the two groups we found no differences in the magnitude of adaptation nor in the modulation of perceptual choices by the previous choice. In conclusion, we find no evidence of a decreased integration of the past in visual perception of low-level stimulus features in autistic adolescents.},

	Abstract = {Recent data has revealed dissociations between social and non-social skills in both autistic and neurotypical populations. In the present study, we investigated whether specific visuospatial abilities, such as figure disembedding and mental rotation, are differently related to social and non-social autistic traits, in neurotypical women and men. University students (N = 426) completed the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ), figure disembedding and mental rotation of two-dimensional figures tasks. AQ social skills (AQ-social) and attention-to-details (AQ-attention) subscales were used as measures of social and non-social autistic traits, respectively. Mental rotation was affected by a significant interaction between sex, social and non-social traits. When non-social traits were above the mean (+ 1 SD), no sex differences in mental rotation were found. Instead, below this value, sex differences depended on the social traits, with men on average outperforming women at middle-to-high social traits, and with a comparable performance, and with women on average outperforming men, at lower social traits. A small positive correlation between figure disembedding and social traits was observed in the overall sample. These results are interpreted in terms of the hyper-systemizing theory of autism and contribute to the evidence of individual differences in the cognitive style of autistic people and neurotypical people with autistic traits.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>The neurocognitive mechanisms underlying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remain unclear. Progress has been largely hampered by small sample sizes, variable age ranges and resulting inconsistent findings. There is a pressing need for large definitive studies to delineate the nature and extent of key case/control differences to direct research towards fruitful areas for future investigation. Here we focus on perception of biological motion, a promising index of social brain function which may be altered in ASD. In a large sample ranging from childhood to adulthood, we assess whether biological motion preference differs in ASD compared to neurotypical participants (NT), how differences are modulated by age and sex and whether they are associated with dimensional variation in concurrent or later symptomatology.<h4>Methods</h4>Eye-tracking data were collected from 486 6-to-30-year-old autistic (N = 282) and non-autistic control (N = 204) participants whilst they viewed 28 trials pairing biological (BM) and control (non-biological, CTRL) motion. Preference for the biological motion stimulus was calculated as (1) proportion looking time difference (BM-CTRL) and (2) peak look duration difference (BM-CTRL).<h4>Results</h4>The ASD group showed a present but weaker preference for biological motion than the NT group. The nature of the control stimulus modulated preference for biological motion in both groups. Biological motion preference did not vary with age, gender, or concurrent or prospective social communicative skill within the ASD group, although a lack of clear preference for either stimulus was associated with higher social-communicative symptoms at baseline.<h4>Limitations</h4>The paired visual preference we used may underestimate preference for a stimulus in younger and lower IQ individuals. Our ASD group had a lower average IQ by approximately seven points. 18% of our sample was not analysed for various technical and behavioural reasons.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Biological motion preference elicits small-to-medium-sized case-control effects, but individual differences do not strongly relate to core social autism associated symptomatology. We interpret this as an autistic difference (as opposed to a deficit) likely manifest in social brain regions. The extent to which this is an innate difference present from birth and central to the autistic phenotype, or the consequence of a life lived with ASD, is unclear.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Reward processing has been proposed to underpin the atypical social feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, previous neuroimaging studies have yielded inconsistent results regarding the specificity of atypicalities for social reward processing in ASD.<h4>Aims</h4>Utilising a large sample, we aimed to assess reward processing in response to reward type (social, monetary) and reward phase (anticipation, delivery) in ASD.<h4>Method</h4>Functional magnetic resonance imaging during social and monetary reward anticipation and delivery was performed in 212 individuals with ASD (7.6-30.6 years of age) and 181 typically developing participants (7.6-30.8 years of age).<h4>Results</h4>Across social and monetary reward anticipation, whole-brain analyses showed hypoactivation of the right ventral striatum in participants with ASD compared with typically developing participants. Further, region of interest analysis across both reward types yielded ASD-related hypoactivation in both the left and right ventral striatum. Across delivery of social and monetary reward, hyperactivation of the ventral striatum in individuals with ASD did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. Dimensional analyses of autism and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) scores were not significant. In categorical analyses, <i>post hoc</i> comparisons showed that ASD effects were most pronounced in participants with ASD without co-occurring ADHD.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results do not support current theories linking atypical social interaction in ASD to specific alterations in social reward processing. Instead, they point towards a generalised hypoactivity of ventral striatum in ASD during anticipation of both social and monetary rewards. We suggest this indicates attenuated reward seeking in ASD independent of social content and that elevated ADHD symptoms may attenuate altered reward seeking in ASD.},

	Abstract = {As an integral part of autism spectrum symptoms, sensory processing issues including both hypo and hyper sensory sensitivities. These sensory specificities may result from an excitation/inhibition imbalance with a poorly understood of their level of convergence with genetic alterations in GABA-ergic and glutamatergic pathways. In our study, we aimed to characterize the hypo/hyper-sensory profile among autistic individuals. We then explored its link with the burden of deleterious mutations in a subset of individuals with available whole-genome sequencing data. To characterize the hypo/hyper-sensory profile, the differential Short Sensory Profile (dSSP) was defined as a normalized and centralized hypo/hypersensitivity ratio from the Short Sensory Profile (SSP). Including 1136 participants (533 autistic individuals, 210 first-degree relatives, and 267 controls) from two independent study samples (PARIS and LEAP), we observed a statistically significant dSSP mean difference between autistic individuals and controls, driven mostly by a high dSSP variability, with an intermediated profile represented by relatives. Our genetic analysis tended to associate the dSSP and the hyposensitivity with mutations of the GABAergic pathway. The major limitation was the dSSP difficulty to discriminate subjects with a similar quantum of hypo- and hyper-sensory symptoms to those with no such symptoms, resulting both in a similar ratio score of 0. However, the dSSP could be a relevant clinical score, and combined with additional sensory descriptions, genetics and endophenotypic substrates, will improve the exploration of the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of sensory processing differences in autism spectrum.},

	Abstract = {Common genetic variation has been associated with multiple symptoms in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). However, our knowledge of shared genetic factor structures contributing to this highly heterogeneous neurodevelopmental condition is limited. Here, we developed a structural equation modelling framework to directly model genome-wide covariance across core and non-core ASD phenotypes, studying autistic individuals of European descent using a case-only design. We identified three independent genetic factors most strongly linked to language/cognition, behaviour and motor development, respectively, when studying a population-representative sample (N=5,331). These analyses revealed novel associations. For example, developmental delay in acquiring personal-social skills was inversely related to language, while developmental motor delay was linked to self-injurious behaviour. We largely confirmed the three-factorial structure in independent ASD-simplex families (N=1,946), but uncovered simplex-specific genetic overlap between behaviour and language phenotypes. Thus, the common genetic architecture in ASD is multi-dimensional and contributes, in combination with ascertainment-specific patterns, to phenotypic heterogeneity.},

	Abstract = {Discriminating between similar scenes proves to be a remarkably demanding task due to the limited capacity of our visual cognitive processes. Here we examine how visual scene discrimination is modulated by perceptual differences arising from neurodiversity. A large sample of autistic (n = 140) and typical (n = 147) participants completed two visual scene discrimination experiments online. Each experiment consisted of “match” (identical scenes) and “mismatch” (subtle differences between scenes) conditions. In both experiments, we found strong evidence for an interaction between group and task condition. Specifically, when compared to typical controls, autistic individuals were on average more accurate at identifying subtle differences between scenes. Taken together, these results suggest differential processing of contextual expectations in autism. These findings are consistent with both classic cognitive theories and more recent Bayesian explanations of autistic perception. In addition, this work highlights the strengths of neurodiversity in specific areas of cognition.},

	Abstract = {Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental conditions that are for subsets of individuals, underpinned by dysregulated immune processes, including inflammation, autoimmunity, and dysbiosis. Consequently, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-hosted human leukocyte antigen (HLA) has been implicated in ASD risk, although seldom investigated. By utilizing a GWAS performed by the EU-AIMS consortium (LEAP cohort), we compared HLA and MHC genetic variants, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), and haplotypes in ASD individuals, versus typically developing controls. We uncovered six SNPs, namely rs9268528, rs9268542, rs9268556, rs14004, rs9268557, and rs8084 that crossed the Bonferroni threshold, which form the underpinnings of 3 independent genetic pathways/blocks that differentially associate with ASD. Block 1 (rs9268528-G, rs9268542-G, rs9268556-C, and rs14004-A) afforded protection against ASD development, whilst the two remaining blocks, namely rs9268557-T, and rs8084-A, associated with heightened risk. rs8084 and rs14004 mapped to the HLA-DRA gene, whilst the four other SNPs located in the BTNL2 locus. Different combinations amongst BTNL2 SNPs and HLA amino acid variants or classical alleles were found either to afford protection from or contribute to ASD risk, indicating a genetic interplay between BTNL2 and HLA. Interestingly, the detected variants had transcriptional and/or quantitative traits loci implications. As BTNL2 modulates gastrointestinal homeostasis and the identified HLA alleles regulate the gastrointestinal tract in celiac disease, it is proposed that the data on ASD risk may be linked to genetically regulated gut inflammatory processes. These findings might have implications for the prevention and treatment of ASD, via the targeting of gut-related processes.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Fine motor skills are heritable and comprise important milestones in development, and some evidence suggests that impairments in fine motor skills are associated with neurodevelopmental conditions, psychiatric disorders, and poor educational outcomes.<h4>Methods</h4>In a preregistered study of 9625 preschool children from TEDS (Twins Early Development Study), fine motor assessments (drawing, block building, folding, and questionnaires) were conducted at 2, 3, and 4 years of age. A cross-age fine motor score was derived using principal component analysis. Multivariate regression analysis was used to examine the relationships between the fine motor score and neurodevelopmental traits, psychopathology, and educational outcomes at 3 later ages (7-8, 12, and 16 years) and cross-age psychopathology composite scores. Polygenic scores (PGSs) were created for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, schizophrenia, anxiety, major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and years of education. We ran single-PGS models and a multi-PGS model.<h4>Results</h4>Fine motor skills were negatively associated with neurodevelopmental traits and psychopathology across childhood and adolescence and positively associated with educational achievement in adolescence (β = 0.25, p < .001). Superior fine motor skills were associated with a higher years-of-education PGS (β = 0.07, p < .001), a lower ADHD PGS (β = -0.04, p = .011), and a higher anxiety PGS (β = 0.03, p = .040). Similarly, the multi-PGS model retained the PGSs for years of education (β = 0.07), ADHD (β = -0.03), and anxiety (β = 0.01). A non-preregistered analysis in an independent preschool sample replicated the ADHD PGS association, but not the years of education or anxiety PGS associations.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Fine motor skills are linked genetically and phenotypically to later neurodevelopment, psychopathology, and educational outcomes. Future work should investigate the mechanisms that underlie the role of fine motor development in later outcomes.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Autism spectrum disorder (autism) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition with pronounced behavioral, cognitive, and neural heterogeneities across individuals. Here, our goal was to characterize heterogeneity in autism by identifying patterns of neural diversity as reflected in BOLD fMRI in the way individuals with autism engage with a varied array of cognitive tasks.<h4>Methods</h4>All analyses were based on the EU-AIMS/AIMS-2-TRIALS multisite Longitudinal European Autism Project (LEAP) with participants with autism (n = 282) and typically developing (TD) controls (n = 221) between 6 and 30 years of age. We employed a novel task potency approach which combines the unique aspects of both resting state fMRI and task-fMRI to quantify task-induced variations in the functional connectome. Normative modelling was used to map atypicality of features on an individual basis with respect to their distribution in neurotypical control participants. We applied robust out-of-sample canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to relate connectome data to behavioral data.<h4>Results</h4>Deviation from the normative ranges of global functional connectivity was greater for individuals with autism compared to TD in each fMRI task paradigm (all tasks p < 0.001). The similarity across individuals of the deviation pattern was significantly increased in autistic relative to TD individuals (p < 0.002). The CCA identified significant and robust brain-behavior covariation between functional connectivity atypicality and autism-related behavioral features.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Individuals with autism engage with tasks in a globally atypical way, but the particular spatial pattern of this atypicality is nevertheless similar across tasks. Atypicalities in the tasks originate mostly from prefrontal cortex and default mode network regions, but also speech and auditory networks. We show how sophisticated modeling methods such as task potency and normative modeling can be used toward unravelling complex heterogeneous conditions like autism.},

	Abstract = {Sensory differences are a core feature of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and are predictive of other ASD core symptoms such as social difficulties. However, the neurobiological substrate underlying the functional relationship between sensory and social functioning is poorly understood. Here, we examined whether misregulation of structural plasticity in the somatosensory cortex modulates aberrant social functioning in BTBR mice, a mouse model for autism spectrum disorder-like phenotypes. By locally expressing a dominant-negative form of Cofilin (CofilinS3D; a key regulator of synaptic structure) in the somatosensory cortex, we tested whether somatosensory suppression of Cofilin activity alters social functioning in BTBR mice. Somatosensory Cofilin suppression altered social contact and nest-hide behavior of BTBR mice in a social colony, assessed for seven consecutive days. Subsequent behavioral testing revealed that altered social functioning is related to altered tactile sensory perception; CofilinS3D-treated BTBR mice showed a time-dependent difference in the sensory bedding preference task. These findings show that Cofilin suppression in the somatosensory cortex alters social functioning in BTBR mice and that this is associated with tactile sensory processing, a critical indicator of somatosensory functioning.},

	Abstract = {The neurobiological mechanisms underlying Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) remains controversial. One factor contributing to this debate is the phenotypic heterogeneity observed in ASD, which suggests that multiple system disruptions may contribute to diverse patterns of impairment which have been reported between and within study samples. Here, we used SFARI data to address genetic imbalances affecting the dopaminergic system. Using complex network analysis, we investigated the relations between phenotypic profiles, gene dosage and gene ontology (GO) terms related to dopaminergic neurotransmission from a polygenic point-of-view. We observed that the degree of distribution of the networks matched a power-law distribution characterized by the presence of hubs, gene or GO nodes with a large number of interactions. Furthermore, we identified interesting patterns related to subnetworks of genes and GO terms, which suggested applicability to separation of clinical clusters (Developmental Delay (DD) versus ASD). This has the potential to improve our understanding of genetic variability issues and has implications for diagnostic categorization. In ASD, we identified the separability of four key dopaminergic mechanisms disrupted with regard to receptor binding, synaptic physiology and neural differentiation, each belonging to particular subgroups of ASD participants, whereas in DD a more unitary biological pattern was found. Finally, network analysis was fed into a machine learning binary classification framework to differentiate between the diagnosis of ASD and DD. Subsets of 1846 participants were used to train a Random Forest algorithm. Our best classifier achieved, on average, a diagnosis-predicting accuracy of 85.18% (sd 1.11%) on the test samples of 790 participants using 117 genes. The achieved accuracy surpassed results using genetic data and closely matched imaging approaches addressing binary diagnostic classification. Importantly, we observed a similar prediction accuracy when the classifier uses only 62 GO features. This result further corroborates the complex network analysis approach, suggesting that different genetic causes might converge to the dysregulation of the same set of biological mechanisms, leading to a similar disease phenotype. This new biology-driven ontological framework yields a less variable and more compact domain-related set of features with potential mechanistic generalization. The proposed network analysis, allowing for the determination of a clearcut biological distinction between ASD and DD (the latter presenting much lower modularity and heterogeneity), is amenable to machine learning approaches and provides an interesting avenue of research for the future.},

	Abstract = {Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiency (GD) is a disorder characterized by absent or delayed puberty, with largely unknown genetic causes. The purpose of this study was to obtain and exploit gene expression profiles of GnRH neurons during development to unveil novel biological mechanisms and genetic determinants underlying GD. Here, we combined bioinformatic analyses of immortalized and primary embryonic GnRH neuron transcriptomes with exome sequencing from GD patients to identify candidate genes implicated in the pathogenesis of GD. Among differentially expressed and filtered transcripts, we found loss-of-function (LoF) variants of the autism-linked neuroligin 3 (NLGN3) gene in two unrelated patients co-presenting with GD and neurodevelopmental traits. We demonstrated that NLGN3 is upregulated in maturing GnRH neurons and that NLGN3 wild-type, but not mutant, protein promotes neuritogenesis when overexpressed in developing GnRH cells. Our data represent proof of principle that this complementary approach can identify new candidate GD genes and demonstrate that LoF NLGN3 variants can contribute to GD. This novel genotype-phenotype correlation implies common genetic mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental disorders, such as GD and autistic spectrum disorder.},

	Abstract = {Autism is a heritable and common neurodevelopmental condition, with behavioural symptoms typically emerging around age 2 to 3 years. Differences in basic perceptual processes have been documented in autistic children and adults. Specifically, data from many experiments suggest links between autism and alterations in global visual motion processing (i.e., when individual motion information is integrated to perceive an overall coherent pattern). Yet, no study has investigated whether a distinctive organization of global motion processing precede the emergence of autistic symptoms in early childhood. Here, using a validated infant electroencephalography (EEG) experimental paradigm, we first establish the normative activation profiles for global form, global motion, local form, and local motion in the visual cortex based on data from two samples of 5-month-old infants (total n = 473). Further, in a sample of 5-month-olds at elevated likelihood of autism (n = 52), we show that a different topographical organization of global motion processing is associated with autistic symptoms in toddlerhood. These findings advance the understanding of neural organization of infants' basic visual processing, and its role in the development of autism.},

Here, we characterise developmental trajectories in sleep onset latency (SOL) and night awakenings in infants at elevated likelihood (EL) for ASD (who have an older sibling with ASD) and infants at typical likelihood (TL) for ASD. Further, we test whether the ability to gate tactile input, using an EEG tactile suppression index (TSI), associates with variation in SOL and night awakenings. Parent-reported night awakenings and SOL from 124 infants (97 at EL for ASD) at 5, 10 and 14 months were analyzed using generalized estimating equations. Compared to TL infants, infants at EL had significantly more awakenings and longer SOL at 10 and 14 months. The TSI predicted SOL concurrently at 10 months, independent of ASD likelihood status, but not longitudinally at 14 months. The TSI did not predict night awakenings concurrently or longitudinally. These results imply that infants at EL for ASD wake up more frequently during the night and take longer to fall asleep from 10 months of age. At 10 months, sensory gating predicts SOL, but not night awakenings, suggesting sensory gating differentially affects neural mechanisms of sleep initiation and maintenance.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Pragmatic language is key for adaptive communication, but often compromised in neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Decontextualized language-to talk about events and things beyond here and now-develops early in childhood and can be seen as a pre-pragmatic ability. Little is known about the factors that contribute to decontextualized language use in toddlers and whether these are different from factors contributing to general language development.<h4>Methods</h4>We studied longitudinal associations between parent-rated core language and non-verbal socio-communicative abilities at 14 months of age, and decontextualized language use at 24 months of age in children with typical and elevated likelihood of ASD (total <i>N</i> = 303). Using twin modelling, we also investigated genetic and environmental contributions on decontextualized language and grammar use in two-year-old twin pairs (total <i>N =</i> 374).<h4>Results</h4>Core language ability was a strong predictor of later decontextualized language use in both children with and without an elevated likelihood of ASD. In contrast, social communication was only a significant predictor of decontextualized language use for children with low levels of core language. This pattern was specific to decontextualized language, and not replicated in prediction of concurrent grammatical ability. Further, there was a large genetic influence on decontextualized language at 2 years of age, which mostly overlapped with the genetic influences on grammatical ability. Shared environment influences were significant for grammatical ability, but not found on decontextualized language. In children with an elevated likelihood of ASD, decontextualized language use was negatively associated with autistic symptoms.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study suggests that decontextualized language is developmentally associated with, yet dissociable from, more general language development measured as grammatical ability. Already at 2 years of age, parental ratings of decontextualized language is associated to clinician-rated symptoms of ASD.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has a high cost to affected individuals and society, but treatments for core symptoms are lacking. To expand intervention options, it is crucial to gain a better understanding of potential treatment targets, and their engagement, in the brain. For instance, the striatum (caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens) plays a central role during development and its (atypical) functional connectivity (FC) may contribute to multiple ASD symptoms. We have previously shown, in the adult autistic and neurotypical brain, the non-intoxicating cannabinoid cannabidivarin (CBDV) alters the balance of striatal 'excitatory-inhibitory' metabolites, which help regulate FC, but the effects of CBDV on (atypical) striatal FC are unknown.<h4>Methods</h4>To examine this in a small pilot study, we acquired resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 28 men (15 neurotypicals, 13 ASD) on two occasions in a repeated-measures, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. We then used a seed-based approach to (1) compare striatal FC between groups and (2) examine the effect of pharmacological probing (600 mg CBDV/matched placebo) on atypical striatal FC in ASD. Visits were separated by at least 13 days to allow for drug washout.<h4>Results</h4>Compared to the neurotypicals, ASD individuals had lower FC between the ventral striatum and frontal and pericentral regions (which have been associated with emotion, motor, and vision processing). Further, they had higher intra-striatal FC and higher putamenal FC with temporal regions involved in speech and language. In ASD, CBDV reduced hyperconnectivity to the neurotypical level.<h4>Limitations</h4>Our findings should be considered in light of several methodological aspects, in particular our participant group (restricted to male adults), which limits the generalizability of our findings to the wider and heterogeneous ASD population.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In conclusion, here we show atypical striatal FC with regions commonly associated with ASD symptoms. We further provide preliminary proof of concept that, in the adult autistic brain, acute CBDV administration can modulate atypical striatal circuitry towards neurotypical function. Future studies are required to determine whether modulation of striatal FC is associated with a change in ASD symptoms.<h4>Trial registration</h4>clinicaltrials.gov, Identifier: NCT03537950.

Nevertheless, our knowledge about the divergence of the underlying somatosensory region and its association with ASD phenotype features is limited. <h4>METHODS</h4> We applied a data-driven approach to map the fine-grained variations in functional connectivity of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) to the rest of the brain in 240 autistic and 164 neurotypical individuals from the EU-AIMS LEAP dataset, aged between 7 and 30. We estimated the S1 connection topography (‘connectopy’) during rest and during the emotional face-matching (Hariri) task, an established measure of emotion reactivity, and accessed its association with a set of clinical and behavioral variables. <h4>RESULTS</h4> We demonstrated that the S1 connectopy is organized along a dorsoventral axis, mapping onto the somatotopic organization of S1. We found that its spatial characteristics were linked to the individuals’ adaptive functioning skills, as measured by the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, across the whole sample. Higher functional differentiation characterized the S1 connectopies of individuals with higher daily life adaptive skills. Notably, we detected significant differences between rest and the Hariri task in the S1 connectopies, as well as their projection maps onto the rest of the brain suggesting a task-modulating effect on S1 due to emotion processing. <h4>CONCLUSIONS</h4> Variation of daily life adaptive skills appears to be reflected in the brain’s mesoscale neural circuitry, as shown by the S1 connectivity profile, which is also differentially modulated during rest and emotional processing.},

In line with this aim, this study explores the diversity of the research workforce in the context of a European autism neuroscience research consortium (AIMS-2-TRIALS). By investigating potential power imbalances between researchers of different backgrounds and at different career levels, we aim to investigate the impact of such imbalances on career and mental health. A survey was administered to AIMS-2-TRIALS researchers (including students, early, mid, and advanced career levels), obtaining 124 complete respondents. While autistic researchers were present in this sample (4% formally diagnosed, 19.23% self-identified), they were under-represented in senior and clinical roles. Neuro-identity emerged as the primary predictor of mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression. Also, while researchers in the sample were mostly women (74%), income was consistently lower in women. These findings emphasise the need to consider underrepresentation of intersecting marginalised identities within consortia like AIMS-2-TRIALS, and to redistribute roles and resources. The recognition of mental health and socio-economic challenges faced by neurodivergent and female researchers in this field constitute a barrier to career progression that calls for recognition and intervention.},

	Abstract = {We conducted a comprehensive review of behavioral and educational interventions for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The most prominent type of intervention, Comprehensive Early Intervention, often referred to as Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention (EIBI), has been found to be particularly effective in improving intelligence and adaptive behaviors. The naturalistic developmental behavioral intervention, designed to enhance social and communication abilities, showed effectiveness in improving language, cognitive function, and social initiation. However, more studies are needed to examine its effectiveness. Intensive individualized intervention, which provides a tailored intervention for a specific target behavior, was effective in improving social skills and communication, as well as reducing sleep, eating, and toileting problems. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most effective method for dealing with emotional difficulties, but it has not been widely used because of the shortage of trained experts. Parent-mediated intervention (PMI) involves parents acquiring knowledge and specific skills to improve their child's functioning or reduce challenging behaviors. Speech and language therapy, sensory integration, Treatment and Education of Autistic and related Communications Handicapped Children, developmental approaches, and social stories are frequently used interventions. However, evidence of their effectiveness has yet to be well established. Based on these findings, intervention recommendations for autism include EIBI, Early Start Denver Model, intensive individualized intervention, CBT, and PMI. The choice of intervention should be tailored to the individual's needs and delivered by qualified professionals with expertise in the specific intervention.},

Common genetic variants were associated with the core factors, but de novo variants were not. We found that higher autism polygenic scores (PGS) were associated with lower likelihood of co-occurring developmental disabilities in autistic individuals. Furthermore, in autistic individuals without co-occurring intellectual disability (ID), autism PGS are overinherited by autistic females compared to males. Finally, we observed higher SNP heritability for autistic males and for autistic individuals without ID. Deeper phenotypic characterization will be critical in determining how the complex underlying genetics shape cognition, behavior and co-occurring conditions in autism.},

However, little is known about factors that may explain this relationship or if higher maternal age is related to the number of autistic-like traits in offspring. One possibility is that mothers who have a higher number of autistic-like traits, including greater challenges performing mentalizing skills, are delayed in finding a partner. The goal of our study is to assess the relationship between maternal age, mentalizing skills and autistic-like traits as independent predictors of the number of autistic-like traits in offspring.<h4>Methods</h4>In a population-based study in the Netherlands, information on maternal age was collected during pre- and perinatal enrolment. Maternal mentalizing skills and autistic-like traits were assessed using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test and the Autism Spectrum Quotient, respectively. Autistic-like traits in children were assessed with the Social Responsiveness Scale. A total of 5718 mother/child dyads had complete data (M<sub>agechild</sub> = 13.5 years; 50.2% girls).<h4>Results</h4>The relationship between maternal age and autistic-like traits in offspring best fits a U-shaped curve. Furthermore, higher levels of autistic features in mothers are linked to higher levels of autistic-like traits in their children. Lower mentalizing performance in mothers is linked to higher levels of autistic-like traits in their children.<h4>Limitations</h4>We were able to collect data on both autistic-like traits and the mentalizing skills test in a large population of mothers, but we did not collect these data in a large number of the fathers.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The relationships between older and younger mothers may have comparable underlying mechanisms, but it is also possible that the tails of the U-shaped curve are influenced by disparate mechanisms.},

Atypical eye contact is common in autism, but how and when this aspect of autism develops is not well understood. Here, we studied whether how much and how quickly infants respond to others' direct gaze is associated with autism in toddlerhood. We did this by measuring direct-gaze responses in a playful social interaction using live eye tracking. The study included 169 infants, of whom 129 had an elevated likelihood of developing autism due to having a first-degree family member with the condition, and 40 with typical likelihood of autism. In the elevated likelihood group, 35 were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder at 3 years of age, and 94 were not. The results showed that infants in all three groups tended to increase their looking towards the adult's face after the adult looked directly at them. However, neither how much nor how quickly the infants responded to direct gaze by looking back at the adult reliably differentiated the infants with or without subsequent autism. While infants in the elevated likelihood of autism and subsequent diagnosis group tended to look away quicker from faces with direct gaze than infants in the typical likelihood group, this measure did not differentiate between the two elevated likelihood groups. We interpret the results as supporting the view that atypical direct-gaze responses are not early markers of autism.},

This perspective article first reviews the origins and concept of precision medicine approaches to autism and summarises recent findings from the first "generation" of biomarker studies. Multi-disciplinary research initiatives created substantially larger, comprehensively characterised cohorts, shifted the focus from group-comparisons to individual variability and subgroups, increased methodological rigour and advanced analytic innovations. However, although several candidate markers with probabilistic value have been identified, separate efforts to divide autism by molecular, brain structural/functional or cognitive markers have not identified a validated diagnostic subgroup. Conversely, studies of specific monogenic subgroups revealed substantial variability in biology and behaviour. The second part discusses both conceptual and methodological factors in these findings. It is argued that the predominant reductionist approach, which seeks to parse complex issues into simpler, more tractable units, let us to neglect the interactions between brain and body, and divorce individuals from their social environment. The third part draws on insights from systems biology, developmental psychology and neurodiversity approaches to outline an integrative approach that considers the dynamic interaction between biological (brain, body) and social mechanisms (stress, stigma) to understanding the origins of autistic features in particular conditions and contexts. This requires 1) closer collaboration with autistic people to increase face validity of concepts and methodologies; (2) development of measures/technologies that enable repeat assessment of social and biological factors in different (naturalistic) conditions and contexts, (3) new analytic methods to study (simulate) these interactions (including emergent properties), and (4) cross-condition designs to understand which mechanisms are transdiagnostic or specific for particular autistic sub-populations. Tailored support may entail both creating more favourable conditions in the social environment and interventions for some autistic people to increase well-being.},

	Abstract = {Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition affecting ~1% of the population. Recently, machine learning models have been trained to classify participants with autism using their neuroimaging features, though the performance of these models varies in the literature. Differences in experimental setup hamper the direct comparison of different machine-learning approaches. In this paper, five of the most widely used and best-performing machine learning models in the field were trained to classify participants with autism and typically developing (TD) participants, using functional connectivity matrices, structural volumetric measures, and phenotypic information from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) dataset. Their performance was compared under the same evaluation standard. The models implemented included: graph convolutional networks (GCN), edge-variational graph convolutional networks (EV-GCN), fully connected networks (FCN), autoencoder followed by a fully connected network (AE-FCN) and support vector machine (SVM). Our results show that all models performed similarly, achieving a classification accuracy around 70%. Our results suggest that different inclusion criteria, data modalities, and evaluation pipelines rather than different machine learning models may explain variations in accuracy in the published literature. The highest accuracy in our framework was obtained when using ensemble models (p < 0.001), leading to an accuracy of 72.2% and AUC = 0.77 using GCN classifiers. However, an SVM classifier performed with an accuracy of 70.1% and AUC = 0.77, just marginally below GCN, and significant differences were not found when comparing different algorithms under the same testing conditions (p > 0.05). Furthermore, we also investigated the stability of features identified by the different machine learning models using the SmoothGrad interpretation method. The FCN model demonstrated the highest stability in selecting relevant features contributing to model decision making.

For example, rigid and inflexible behaviour, a preference for routine and social difficulties are seen in both conditions. In this study, we examined whether people with anorexia and people with autism show similarities in social attention (where they look while engaging in social interactions or watching a scene with people interacting). This could help us understand why people with anorexia and autism experience difficulties in social situations. Participants with either anorexia or autism, as well as participants with no mental health problems watched a video of a social scene while we recorded which parts of the scene they looked at with an eye-tracker. Participants also completed questionnaires to assess characteristics of autism. We found that autistic participants looked at faces less than typically developing participants. However, participants with anorexia did not show a similar reduction in attention to faces, contrary to our predictions. Autistic features were not related to attention in either group. The results suggest that autistic people may miss important social cues (like facial expressions), potentially contributing to social difficulties. However, this mechanism does not appear explain social difficulties in people with anorexia.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Lay abstract</h4>Autism spectrum disorders are complex, with a strong genetic basis. Genetic research in autism spectrum disorders is limited by the fact that these disorders are largely heterogeneous so that patients are variable in their clinical presentations. To address this limitation, we investigated the genetics of individual dimensions of the autism spectrum disorder phenotypes, or autistic-like traits. These autistic-like traits are continuous variations in autistic behaviours that occur in the general population. Therefore, we meta-analysed data from four different population cohorts in which autistic-like traits were measured. We performed a set of genetic analyses to identify common variants for autistic-like traits, understand how these variants related to autism spectrum disorders, and how they contribute to neurobiological processes. Our results showed genetic associations with specific autistic-like traits and a link to the immune system. We offer an example of the potential to use a dimensional approach when dealing with heterogeneous, complex disorder like autism spectrum disorder. Decomposing the complex autism spectrum disorder phenotype in its core features can inform on the specific biology of these features which is likely to account to clinical variability in patients.},

	Abstract = {Theta oscillations (spectral power and connectivity) are sensitive to the social content of an experience in typically developing infants, providing a possible marker of early social brain development. Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition affecting early social behaviour, but links to underlying social brain function remain unclear. We explored whether modulations of theta spectral power and connectivity by naturalistic social content in infancy are related to family history for autism. Fourteen-month-old infants with (family history; FH; N = 75) and without (no family history; NFH; N = 26) a first-degree relative with autism watched social and non-social videos during EEG recording. We calculated theta (4-5 Hz) spectral power and connectivity modulations (social-non-social) and associated them with outcomes at 36 months. We replicated previous findings of increased theta power and connectivity during social compared to non-social videos. Theta modulations with social content were similar between groups, for both power and connectivity. Together, these findings suggest that neural responses to naturalistic social stimuli may not be strongly altered in 14-month-old infants with family history of autism.},

	DOI = {10.21203/rs.3.rs-1669320/v2},
	Abstract = {<h4>Background: </h4> We aimed to assess whether autistic individuals were able to generalise across contexts when building statistical expectations of their environment to the same extent as non-autistic individuals. We did this by assessing the implicit awareness of statistical regularities in a sequence of naturalistic scene images in both autistic and non-autistic individuals. <h4>Methods: </h4> 125 participants (61 participants with an autism diagnosis and 64 non-autistic controls) were presented with a fast serial presentation sequence of images and given a cover task to avoid attention being explicitly drawn to patterns in the underlying sequences. This was followed by a two-alternative forced choice task to assess participants’ implicit recall. Participants were presented with 1 of 3 unique versions of the task, in which the presentation and assessment of statistical regularities was done at either a low feature-based level or a high semantic-based level. <h4>Results: </h4> There were no significant group differences in how performance varied across the 3 conditions, but there was an overall significant reduction in visual statistical learning in the autistic group. There was also a lack of statistical significant effect of learning for the autistic participants who completed the generalisation condition. Limitations While the overall sample was fairly large, the sample sizes for the subgroups within the study were modest, so the lack of statistically significant effect of learning for the autistic participants who completed the generalisation condition may be due to a lack of power rather than a true absence of learning. Additionally, this study did not directly assess if semantic information was being processed to a similar extent by both autistic and non-autistic participants. <h4>Conclusions: </h4> These results do not support the claim that autistic individuals experience difficulties in either acquiring or generalising statistic regularities at the category-level, but suggest that differences in visual statistical learning occur in autistic people.},

Although many imaging studies have reported structural and functional alterations in multiple brain regions, clinically useful diagnostic imaging biomarkers for ASD remain unavailable.<h4>Methods</h4>In this study, we applied machine learning (ML) models to regional volumetric and cortical thickness data from the largest structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) dataset available from the Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics Through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) consortium (1833 subjects with ASD and 1838 without ASD; age range: 1.5-64; average age: 15.6; male/female ratio: 4.2:1).<h4>Results</h4>The highest classification accuracy on a hold-out test set was achieved using a stacked Extra Tree Classifier. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was 0.62 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.57, 0.68) and the area under the precision-recall curve was 0.58. Learning curve analysis showed the good fit of the model and suggests that more training examples will not likely benefit model performance.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results suggest that sMRI volumetric and cortical thickness data alone may not provide clinically sufficient useful diagnostic biomarkers for ASD. Developing clinically useful imaging classifiers for ASD will benefit from combining other data modalities or feature types, such as functional MRI data and raw images that can leverage other machine learning (ML) techniques such as convolutional neural networks.},

Individuals with AN show high scores on measures of ASD symptoms, relative to individuals without AN, however, there are currently no studies directly comparing women with AN to women with ASD. The aim of the current study was to examine profiles of ASD symptoms in young women in the acute and recovered stages of AN, women with ASD, and typically developing controls (TD), on both self-report and clinical interview measures.<h4>Methods</h4>Four groups of participants aged 12-30 years were included (n = 218): AN, recovered AN (REC), ASD, and TD. Group differences on the Social Responsiveness Scale, 2nd edition (SRS-2), 10-item Autism Quotient (AQ-10), and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, 2nd edition (ADOS-2) were examined. To explore similarities and differences in specific symptom profiles associated with AN and ASD, individual item endorsement on the ADOS-2 was also examined in AN, REC, and ASD.<h4>Results</h4>Across measures, women with ASD showed the highest scores, and TDs the lowest. Generally, individuals with AN and REC showed intermediate levels of ASD symptoms, scoring between the other two groups. However, AN and ASD did not differ on restricted interests and repetitive behaviour subscales. The ADOS-2 item 'quality of social response' adequately discriminated between ASD and non-ASD participants.<h4>Limitations</h4>A full diagnostic assessment for ASD was not provided for participants with AN/REC, nor were eating disorders assessed in the ASD group. Therefore, some diagnostic overlap between groups is possible. The cross-sectional design is another limitation.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results suggest similarities in scores on both self-report and clinical interview measures in AN and ASD. However, individual ADOS-2 item analyses also revealed subtle differences, particularly in reciprocal social interaction. ASD symptoms may be a combination of both state and trait features in AN.},

	Abstract = {Small studies suggest significant differences between autistic and nonautistic individuals regarding sexual orientation and behavior. We administered an anonymized, online survey to n = 2386 adults (n = 1183 autistic) aged 16-90 years to describe sexual activity, risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and sexual orientation. Autistic individuals are less likely to report sexually activity or heterosexuality compared to nonautistic individuals, but more likely to self-report asexuality or an 'other' sexuality. Overall, autistic, and nonautistic groups did not differ in age of sexual activity onset or contraction of STIs. When evaluating sex differences, autistic males are uniquely more likely to be bisexual (compared to nonautistic males); conversely, autistic females are uniquely more likely to be homosexual (compared to nonautistic females). Thus, both autistic males and females may express a wider range of sexual orientations in different sex-specific patterns than general population peers. When comparing autistic males and females directly, females are more likely to have diverse sexual orientations (except for homosexuality) and engage in sexual activity, are less likely to identify as heterosexual, and have a lower mean age at which they first begin engaging in sexual activity. This is the largest study of sexual orientation of autistic adults. Sexual education and sexual health screenings of all children, adolescents, and adults (including autistic individuals) must remain priorities; healthcare professionals should use language that affirms a diversity of sexual orientations and supports autistic individuals who may have increased risks (affecting mental health, physical health, and healthcare quality) due to stress and discrimination from this intersectionality. LAY SUMMARY: This is the largest study on the sexual activity, orientation, and health of autistic adults. This study reaffirms that the majority of autistic adults are interested in sexual relationships and engage in sexual activity. Sexual education and sexual health screenings must remain a priority for all individuals, including those with autism; healthcare professionals should be aware that autistic patients may be more likely to identify as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, Queer, Asexual, and other identities not listed here (LGBTQA+) which may put them at greater risk of mental and physical health difficulties due to discrimination.},

The purpose of this study was to find out if autistic people are being disadvantaged by the criminal justice system if they are arrested. Previous research has shown that autistic people may have difficulties communicating with the police. This study builds on this knowledge by uncovering why autistic people may not feel able to communicate with the police and whether the police made any adjustments to help them. This study also measures the impact of being involved with the criminal justice system on autistic people's mental health, such as stress, meltdowns and shutdowns. The results show that autistic people were not always given the support they felt they needed. For example, not all autistic people had an appropriate adult with them at the police station who could help to make sure they understood what was happening around them. Autistic people were also more likely to feel less able to cope with the stress and more likely to suffer meltdowns and shutdowns because of their involvement with the criminal justice system. We hope this study will help police officers and lawyers to better support autistic people if they become involved with the criminal justice system.},

	Abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition, the underlying pathological mechanisms of which are not yet completely understood. Although several genetic and genomic alterations have been linked to ASD, for the majority of ASD patients, the cause remains unknown, and the condition likely arises due to complex interactions between low-risk genes and environmental factors. There is increasing evidence that epigenetic mechanisms that are highly sensitive to environmental factors and influence gene function without altering the DNA sequence, particularly aberrant DNA methylation, are involved in ASD pathogenesis. This systematic review aimed to update the clinical application of DNA methylation investigations in children with idiopathic ASD, investigating its potential application in clinical settings. To this end, a literature search was performed on different scientific databases using a combination of terms related to the association between peripheral DNA methylation and young children with idiopathic ASD; this search led to the identification of 18 articles. In the selected studies, DNA methylation is investigated in peripheral blood or saliva samples, at both gene-specific and genome-wide levels. The results obtained suggest that peripheral DNA methylation could represent a promising methodology in ASD biomarker research, although further studies are needed to develop DNA-methylation-based clinical applications.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common and heterogeneous neurodevelopmental condition that is characterized by the core symptoms of social communication difficulties and restricted and repetitive behaviors. At present, there is an unmet medical need for therapies to ameliorate these core symptoms in order to improve quality of life of autistic individuals. However, several challenges are currently faced by the ASD community relating to the development of pharmacotherapies, namely in the conduct of clinical trials. Balovaptan is a V1a receptor antagonist that has been investigated to improve social communication difficulties in individuals with ASD. In this viewpoint, we draw upon our recent first-hand experiences of the balovaptan clinical development program to describe current challenges of ASD trials.<h4>Discussion points</h4>The balovaptan trials were conducted in a wide age range of individuals with ASD with the added complexities associated with international trials. When summarizing all three randomized trials of balovaptan, a placebo response was observed across several outcome measures. Placebo response was predicted by greater baseline symptom severity, online recruitment of participants, and less experienced or non-academic trial sites. We also highlight challenges relating to selection of outcome measures in ASD, the impact of baseline characteristics, and the role of expectation bias in influencing trial results.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Taken together, the balovaptan clinical development program has advanced our understanding of the key challenges facing ASD treatment research. The insights gained can be used to inform and improve the design of future clinical trials with the collective aim of developing efficacious therapies to support individuals with ASD.},

	Abstract = {While over 100 genes have been associated with autism, little is known about the prevalence of variants affecting them in individuals without a diagnosis of autism. Nor do we fully appreciate the phenotypic diversity beyond the formal autism diagnosis. Based on data from more than 13,000 individuals with autism and 210,000 undiagnosed individuals, we estimated the odds ratios for autism associated to rare loss-of-function (LoF) variants in 185 genes associated with autism, alongside 2,492 genes displaying intolerance to LoF variants. In contrast to autism-centric approaches, we investigated the correlates of these variants in individuals without a diagnosis of autism. We show that these variants are associated with a small but significant decrease in fluid intelligence, qualification level and income and an increase in metrics related to material deprivation. These effects were larger for autism-associated genes than in other LoF-intolerant genes. Using brain imaging data from 21,040 individuals from the UK Biobank, we could not detect significant differences in the overall brain anatomy between LoF carriers and non-carriers. Our results highlight the importance of studying the effect of the genetic variants beyond categorical diagnosis and the need for more research to understand the association between these variants and sociodemographic factors, to best support individuals carrying these variants.},

Twin studies can help to disentangle child contributions to parent-child interaction, for example, by assessing the influence of the child's genetics on his/her social environment, which includes parental behaviour.<h4>Methods</h4>Infant twins from a community sample [354 monozygotic (MZ), 268 same-sex dizygotic (DZ)] were assessed in terms of PCI at age 5 months. We used the classical twin design to map the aetiology of several parent and child PCI scales and their covariation. We investigated the relations between PCI and later parent-rated child's social communication, language, and autistic traits at ages 2 and 3.<h4>Results</h4>Heritability was below 20% for all the included PCI traits. Unique (nonshared) environmental influences substantially overlapped across several PCI scales, suggesting that idiosyncrasies linked to each session shaped the scoring of several traits in a systematic way. Factor analysis revealed three uncorrelated latent factors, which were conceptualized as 'child negative affect', 'positive affective interaction', and 'parent's supportive strategies'. Parents who were rated highly on 'sensitive responsiveness' at 5 months tended to rate their offspring higher in terms of socio-communicative and language development and lower in terms of autistic traits in the second and third years of life.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study maps the phenotypic and aetiological structure of PCI in early infancy and supports the view that parents' sensitive responsiveness towards their infant is associated with later developmental gains in several domains. We did not find strong evidence of any so-called evocative genetic effects on parents' behaviour. We discuss the results considering the general challenge for lab-based observational PCI measures to capture the richness of parent-child interaction.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Lay abstract</h4>Very little research has looked at how autistic people experience childbirth and the first few months of parenthood. We interviewed 21 autistic and 25 non-autistic women 2-3 months after their baby was born, to find out how they experienced giving birth and being a parent. Some autistic participants found sensory aspects of giving birth difficult, such as noise and being touched. They also wanted healthcare professionals to give them clear information while giving birth. Participants sometimes thought that healthcare professionals did not know enough about autism. Autistic and non-autistic participants both found parenthood difficult at times and autistic parents sometimes had extra difficulties, such as with planning and organising. Autistic participants also felt good at understanding their baby's needs. This research suggests that autistic people would benefit from changes to childbirth and postnatal healthcare such as being communicated with more clearly. It also indicates that healthcare professionals should receive more training about autism.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Children with Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) show cognitive, behavioural and social differences compared to their peers. However, the age and sequence at which these differences begin to emerge is not fully understood. This prospective cohort study examines the cognitive, behavioural, ADHD trait and autism symptom development in infant and pre-school children with NF1 compared with typically developing (TD) children without a family history of neurodevelopmental conditions.<h4>Methods</h4>Data from standardised tests was gathered at 5, 10, 14, 24 and 36 months of age (NF1 n = 35, TD n = 29). Developmental trajectories of cognitive (Mullen Scales of Early Learning, MSEL) and adaptive behavioural (Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, VABS) development from 5 to 36 months were analysed using linear mixed modelling. Measures of ADHD (Child Behavior Checklist) and autism traits (ADOS-2, BOSA-MV and ADI-R) were assessed at 24 and 36 months.<h4>Results</h4>The developmental trajectory of cognitive skills (all domains of the MSEL) and behavioural skills (four domains of the VABS) differed significantly between NF1 and TD groups. Post-hoc tests demonstrated that the NF1 participants scored significantly lower than TD participants at 24 months on all MSEL and VABS domains. The NF1 cohort demonstrated higher mean autism and ADHD traits at 24 months and 14% of the NF1 cohort met a research diagnostic classification for autism at 36 months.<h4>Limitations</h4>The study has a relatively small sample size due to variable retention and rolling recruitment. Due to limitations imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, we utilised the Brief Observation of Symptoms of Autism for Minimally Verbal children (BOSA-MV) for some participants, which was administered online and may not gather as accurate a picture of traits as ADOS-2. The BOSA-MV was utilised for 41% of participants with NF1 at 36 months compared to 11% at 24 months. This may explain the reduction in the percentage of children with NF1 that met autism criteria at 36 months.<h4>Conclusions</h4>By 24 months of age, the NF1 cohort show lower cognitive skills and adaptive behaviour and higher levels of autism and ADHD traits as compared to TD children. This has implications for developmental monitoring and referral for early interventions.<h4>Trial registration</h4>Not applicable.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Autism likelihood is a largely heritable trait. Autism prevalence has a skewed sex ratio, with males being diagnosed more often than females. Steroid hormones play a mediating role in this, as indicated by studies of both prenatal biology and postnatal medical conditions in autistic men and women. It is currently unclear if the genetics of steroid regulation or production interact with the genetic liability for autism.<h4>Methods</h4>To address this, two studies were conducted using publicly available datasets, which focused respectively on rare genetic variants linked to autism and neurodevelopmental conditions (study 1) and common genetic variants (study 2) for autism. In Study 1 an enrichment analysis was conducted, between autism-related genes (SFARI database) and genes that are differentially expressed (FDR<0.1) between male and female placentas, in 1<sup>st</sup> trimester chorionic villi samples of viable pregnancies (n=39). In Study 2 summary statistics of genome wide association studies (GWAS) were used to investigate the genetic correlation between autism and bioactive testosterone, estradiol and postnatal PlGF levels, as well as steroid-related conditions such as polycystic ovaries syndrome (PCOS), age of menarche, and androgenic alopecia. Genetic correlation was calculated based on LD Score regression and results were corrected for multiple testing with FDR.<h4>Results</h4>In Study 1, there was significant enrichment of X-linked autism genes in male-biased placental genes, independently of gene length (n=5 genes, p<0.001). In Study 2, common genetic variance associated with autism did not correlate to the genetics for the postnatal levels of testosterone, estradiol or PlGF, but was associated with the genotypes associated with early age of menarche in females (b=-0.109, FDR-q=0.004) and protection from androgenic alopecia for males (b=-0.135, FDR-q=0.007).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The rare genetic variants associated with autism appear to interact with placental sex differences, while the common genetic variants associated with autism appear to be involved in the regulation of steroid-related traits. These lines of evidence indicate that the likelihood for autism is partly linked to factors mediating physiological sex differences throughout development.},

Since detailed knowledge of their effect on synaptic nanostructure remains limited, we aimed to investigate such alterations in ex11|SH3 SHANK3-KO mice combining expansion and STED microscopy. This enabled high-resolution imaging of mosaic-like arrangements formed by synaptic proteins in both human and murine brain tissue. We found distinct shape-profiles as fingerprints of the murine postsynaptic scaffold across brain regions and genotypes, as well as alterations in the spatial and molecular organization of subsynaptic domains under SHANK3-deficient conditions.

	Abstract = {Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) quality is known to impact and bias neuroanatomical estimates and downstream analysis, including case-control comparisons, and a growing body of work has demonstrated the importance of careful quality control (QC) and evaluated the impact of image and image-processing quality. However, the growing size of typical neuroimaging datasets presents an additional challenge to QC, which is typically extremely time and labour intensive. One of the most important aspects of MRI quality is the accuracy of processed outputs, which have been shown to impact estimated neurodevelopmental trajectories. Here, we evaluate whether the quality of surface reconstructions by FreeSurfer (one of the most widely used MRI processing pipelines) interacts with clinical and demographic factors. We present a tool, FSQC, that enables quick and efficient yet thorough assessment of outputs of the FreeSurfer processing pipeline. We validate our method against other existing QC metrics, including the automated FreeSurfer Euler number, two other manual ratings of raw image quality, and two popular automated QC methods. We show strikingly similar spatial patterns in the relationship between each QC measure and cortical thickness; relationships for cortical volume and surface area are largely consistent across metrics, though with some notable differences. We next demonstrate that thresholding by QC score attenuates but does not eliminate the impact of quality on cortical estimates. Finally, we explore different ways of controlling for quality when examining differences between autistic individuals and neurotypical controls in the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) dataset, demonstrating that inadequate control for quality can alter results of case-control comparisons.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Objective</h4>The male preponderance in prevalence of autism is among the most pronounced sex ratios across neurodevelopmental conditions. The authors sought to elucidate the relationship between autism and typical sex-differential neuroanatomy, cognition, and related gene expression.<h4>Methods</h4>Using a novel deep learning framework trained to predict biological sex based on T<sub>1</sub>-weighted structural brain images, the authors compared sex prediction model performance across neurotypical and autistic males and females. Multiple large-scale data sets comprising T<sub>1</sub>-weighted MRI data were employed at four stages of the analysis pipeline: 1) pretraining, with the UK Biobank sample (>10,000 individuals); 2) transfer learning and validation, with the ABIDE data sets (1,412 individuals, 5-56 years of age); 3) test and discovery, with the EU-AIMS/AIMS-2-TRIALS LEAP data set (681 individuals, 6-30 years of age); and 4) specificity, with the NeuroIMAGE and ADHD200 data sets (887 individuals, 7-26 years of age).<h4>Results</h4>Across both ABIDE and LEAP, features positively predictive of neurotypical males were on average significantly more predictive of autistic males (ABIDE: Cohen's d=0.48; LEAP: Cohen's d=1.34). Features positively predictive of neurotypical females were on average significantly less predictive of autistic females (ABIDE: Cohen's d=1.25; LEAP: Cohen's d=1.29). These differences in sex prediction accuracy in autism were not observed in individuals with ADHD. In autistic females, the male-shifted neurophenotype was further associated with poorer social sensitivity and emotional face processing while also associated with gene expression patterns of midgestational cell types.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results demonstrate an increased resemblance in both autistic male and female individuals' neuroanatomy with male-characteristic patterns associated with typically sex-differential social cognitive features and related gene expression patterns. The findings hold promise for future research aimed at refining the quest for biological mechanisms underpinning the etiology of autism.},

	Abstract = {Autistic traits represent a continuum dimension across the population, with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) being the extreme end of the distribution. Accumulating evidence shows that neuroanatomical and neurofunctional profiles described in relatives of ASD individuals reflect an intermediate neurobiological pattern between the clinical population and healthy controls. This suggests that quantitative measures detecting autistic traits in the general population represent potential candidates for the development of biomarkers identifying early pathophysiological processes associated with ASD. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has been extensively employed to investigate neural development and function. In contrast, the potential of fNIRS to define reliable biomarkers of brain activity has been barely explored. Features of non-invasiveness, portability, ease of administration, and low-operating costs make fNIRS a suitable instrument to assess brain function for differential diagnosis, follow-up, analysis of treatment outcomes, and personalized medicine in several neurological conditions. Here, we introduce a novel standardized procedure with high entertaining value to measure hemodynamic responses (HDR) in the occipital cortex of adult subjects and children. We found that the variability of evoked HDR correlates with the autistic traits of children, assessed by the Autism-Spectrum Quotient. Interestingly, HDR amplitude was especially linked to social and communication features, representing the core symptoms of ASD. These findings establish a quick and easy strategy for measuring visually-evoked cortical activity with fNIRS that optimize the compliance of young subjects, setting the background for testing the diagnostic value of fNIRS visual measurements in the ASD clinical population.},

	Abstract = {It has been hypothesised that romantic partners are more similar than chance in relation to autistic traits. To test this theory, we recruited n = 105 heterosexual couples and examined within-couple correlations for autistic traits [measured using the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ)], empathizing [measured using the Empathy Quotient (EQ)], and systemizing [measured using the Systemizing Quotient-Revised (SQ-R)]. For a subsample that attended the lab (n = 58 couples), we also investigated theory of mind via facial expressions using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and attention to detail, a component within systemizing, using the Embedded Figures Task (EFT). Variable-centred analyses revealed positive within-couple correlations for all measures except EQ, although these effects were only statistically significant for unmarried couples and not for married/engaged couples. Follow-up analyses indicated that the observed couple similarity effects are likely consistent with people pairing with those more similar than chance (initial assortment) rather than becoming alike over time (convergence), and to seeking out self-resembling partners (active assortment) rather than pairing in this manner via social stratification processes (social homogamy). Additionally, a significant within-couple correlation for autistic traits was observed at the meta-analytic level. However, it should be noted that the meta-analytic effect size estimate was small (r = 0.153) and indicates that only ~ 2% of variance in a person's score on a phenotypic measure of autistic traits can be predicted by that of their partner.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Recent research suggests that autistic individuals have shorter lifespans and experience worse health (greater health burden) than non-autistic individuals. Small, qualitative studies suggest that autistic adults also experience poor self-reported healthcare quality.<h4>Methods</h4>An anonymized, cross-sectional, self-report questionnaire was administered to n = 4158 individuals. The study assessed prevalence of chronic health conditions, healthcare quality, differences in overall health inequality score, and effects of the coronavirus pandemic on healthcare quality. We used Fisher's exact tests, binomial logistic regression, and predictive machine learning tools, as appropriate.<h4>Results</h4>The final sample included n = 2649 participants (n = 1285 autistic) aged 16-96 years. Autistic adults reported lower quality healthcare than non-autistic adults across 50/51 items, including poorer access to healthcare and poorer communication, alongside increased anxiety, sensory sensitivity, system-level problems, shutdowns, and meltdowns. Differences between groups were stark: aggregated health inequality scores predicted autism diagnosis, even after stratifying by sex. Autistic adults were also more likely to have chronic health conditions than non-autistic adults. There were no significant differences in healthcare quality for autistic adults before and during the pandemic, although they received relatively poorer quality healthcare than non-autistic adults across both periods.<h4>Limitations</h4>The study's sampling methods are not likely to capture the perspectives of all autistic individuals, especially those with intellectual disability. Both the autistic and control samples are biased towards UK residents, white individuals, those assigned female at birth, and those who completed an undergraduate degree or higher education. As such, these results may limit their generalizability to other groups. Finally, these results relate to self-reported differences in healthcare quality between autistic and non-autistic adults. The observed group differences may in part reflect differences in perception and communication rather than differences in actual healthcare quality.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Autistic adults are more likely to have chronic health conditions alongside self-reported lower quality healthcare than others. Health inequalities between these groups are widespread and dramatic; unfortunately, they existed before and have persisted after the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Pharmacological interventions are frequently used for people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to manage behaviours of concern, including irritability, aggression, and self-injury. Some pharmacological interventions might help treat some behaviours of concern, but can also have adverse effects (AEs).<h4>Objectives</h4>To assess the effectiveness and AEs of pharmacological interventions for managing the behaviours of irritability, aggression, and self-injury in ASD.<h4>Search methods</h4>We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, 11 other databases and two trials registers up to June 2022. We also searched reference lists of relevant studies, and contacted study authors, experts and pharmaceutical companies.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included randomised controlled trials of participants of any age with a clinical diagnosis of ASD, that compared any pharmacological intervention to an alternative drug, standard care, placebo, or wait-list control.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>We used standard Cochrane methods. Primary outcomes were behaviours of concern in ASD, (irritability, aggression and self-injury); and AEs. Secondary outcomes were quality of life, and tolerability and acceptability. Two review authors independently assessed each study for risk of bias, and used GRADE to judge the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.<h4>Main results</h4>We included 131 studies involving 7014 participants in this review. We identified 26 studies as awaiting classification and 25 as ongoing. Most studies involved children (53 studies involved only children under 13 years), children and adolescents (37 studies), adolescents only (2 studies) children and adults (16 studies), or adults only (23 studies). All included studies compared a pharmacological intervention to a placebo or to another pharmacological intervention. Atypical antipsychotics versus placebo At short-term follow-up (up to 6 months), atypical antipsychotics probably reduce irritability compared to placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.25 to -0.55, 12 studies, 973 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), which may indicate a large effect. However, there was no clear evidence of a difference in aggression between groups (SMD -0.44, 95% CI -0.89 to 0.01; 1 study, 77 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Atypical antipsychotics may also reduce self-injury (SMD -1.43, 95% CI -2.24 to -0.61; 1 study, 30 participants; low-certainty evidence), possibly indicating a large effect. There may be higher rates of neurological AEs (dizziness, fatigue, sedation, somnolence, and tremor) in the intervention group (low-certainty evidence), but there was no clear evidence of an effect on other neurological AEs. Increased appetite may be higher in the intervention group (low-certainty evidence), but we found no clear evidence of an effect on other metabolic AEs. There was no clear evidence of differences between groups in musculoskeletal or psychological AEs. Neurohormones versus placebo At short-term follow-up, neurohormones may have minimal to no clear effect on irritability when compared to placebo (SMD -0.18, 95% CI -0.37 to -0.00; 8 studies; 466 participants; very low-certainty evidence), although the evidence is very uncertain. No data were reported for aggression or self -injury. Neurohormones may reduce the risk of headaches slightly in the intervention group, although the evidence is very uncertain. There was no clear evidence of an effect of neurohormones on any other neurological AEs, nor on any psychological, metabolic, or musculoskeletal AEs (low- and very low-certainty evidence). Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-related medications versus placebo At short-term follow-up, ADHD-related medications may reduce irritability slightly (SMD -0.20, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.01; 10 studies, 400 participants; low-certainty evidence), which may indicate a small effect. However, there was no clear evidence that ADHD-related medications have an effect on self-injury (SMD -0.62, 95% CI -1.63 to 0.39; 1 study, 16 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for aggression. Rates of neurological AEs (drowsiness, emotional AEs, fatigue, headache, insomnia, and irritability), metabolic AEs (decreased appetite) and psychological AEs (depression) may be higher in the intervention group, although the evidence is very uncertain (very low-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between groups for any other metabolic, neurological, or psychological AEs (very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for musculoskeletal AEs. Antidepressants versus placebo At short-term follow-up, there was no clear evidence that antidepressants have an effect on irritability (SMD -0.06, 95% CI -0.30 to 0.18; 3 studies, 267 participants; low-certainty evidence). No data for aggression or self-injury were reported or could be included in the analysis. Rates of metabolic AEs (decreased energy) may be higher in participants receiving antidepressants (very low-certainty evidence), although no other metabolic AEs showed clear evidence of a difference. Rates of neurological AEs (decreased attention) and psychological AEs (impulsive behaviour and stereotypy) may also be higher in the intervention group (very low-certainty evidence) although the evidence is very uncertain. There was no clear evidence of any difference in the other metabolic, neurological, or psychological AEs (very low-certainty evidence), nor between groups in musculoskeletal AEs (very low-certainty evidence). Risk of bias We rated most of the studies across the four comparisons at unclear overall risk of bias due to having multiple domains rated as unclear, very few rated as low across all domains, and most having at least one domain rated as high risk of bias.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Evidence suggests that atypical antipsychotics probably reduce irritability, ADHD-related medications may reduce irritability slightly, and neurohormones may have little to no effect on irritability in the short term in people with ASD. There was some evidence that atypical antipsychotics may reduce self-injury in the short term, although the evidence is uncertain. There was no clear evidence that antidepressants had an effect on irritability. There was also little to no difference in aggression between atypical antipsychotics and placebo, or self-injury between ADHD-related medications and placebo. However, there was some evidence that atypical antipsychotics may result in a large reduction in self-injury, although the evidence is uncertain. No data were reported (or could be used) for self-injury or aggression for neurohormones versus placebo. Studies reported a wide range of potential AEs. Atypical antipsychotics and ADHD-related medications in particular were associated with an increased risk of metabolic and neurological AEs, although the evidence is uncertain for atypical antipsychotics and very uncertain for ADHD-related medications. The other drug classes had minimal or no associated AEs.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Autism is proposed to be characterised by an atypical balance of cortical excitation and inhibition (E/I). However, most studies have examined E/I alterations in older autistic individuals, meaning that findings could in part reflect homeostatic compensation. To assess the directionality of effects, it is necessary to examine alterations in E/I balance early in the lifespan before symptom emergence. Recent explanatory frameworks have argued that it is also necessary to consider how early risk features interact with later developing modifier factors to predict autism outcomes.<h4>Method</h4>We indexed E/I balance in early infancy by extracting the aperiodic exponent of the slope of the electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectrum ('1/f'). To validate our index of E/I balance, we tested for differences in the aperiodic exponent in 10-month-old infants with (n = 22) and without (n = 27) neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a condition thought to be characterised by alterations to cortical inhibition. We then tested for E/I alterations in a larger heterogeneous longitudinal cohort of infants with and without a family history of neurodevelopmental conditions (n = 150) who had been followed to early childhood. We tested the relevance of alterations in E/I balance and our proposed modifier, executive attention, by assessing whether associations between 10-month aperiodic slope and 36-month neurodevelopmental traits were moderated by 24-month executive attention. Analyses adjusted for age at EEG assessment, sex and number of EEG trials.<h4>Results</h4>Infants with NF1 were characterised by a higher aperiodic exponent, indicative of greater inhibition, supporting our infant measure of E/I. Longitudinal analyses showed a significant interaction between aperiodic slope and executive attention, such that higher aperiodic exponents predicted greater autistic traits in childhood, but only in infants who also had weaker executive functioning abilities.<h4>Limitations</h4>The current study relied on parent report of infant executive functioning-type abilities; future work is required to replicate effects with objective measures of cognition.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Results suggest alterations in E/I balance are on the developmental pathway to autism outcomes, and that higher executive functioning abilities may buffer the impact of early cortical atypicalities, consistent with proposals that stronger executive functioning abilities may modify the impact of a wide range of risk factors.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Studies of infants with an elevated likelihood of autism spectrum disorder can identify basic developmental processes that are associated with subsequently emerging clinical symptoms. Atypical responsiveness to sounds in infancy is such a potential early marker of autism. Here, we used pupillometry to quantify reactivity to social and nonsocial sounds in infants with a subsequent diagnosis. Previous research suggest that pupil dilation reflects attentional alerting, and link it to the locus coeruleus norepinephrine system.<h4>Methods</h4>We measured pupil dilation responses to child-directed speech and the sound of running water; sounds infants often hear in their everyday life. The final sample consisted of 99 ten-month-old infants (52 girls), of whom 68 had an elevated likelihood of autism and 31 were typically developing low-likelihood infants. At follow-up (36 months of age), 18 children in the elevated-likelihood group were diagnosed with autism.<h4>Results</h4>Compared to infants without diagnosis, the infants who were subsequently diagnosed with autism had larger pupil dilation when listening to nonsocial sounds, while reactivity to speech was strikingly similar between groups. In the total sample, more pupil dilation to the nonsocial sound was associated with higher levels of autistic symptoms. We also found that on a trial-by-trial basis, across all conditions and groups, more pupil dilation was associated with making fewer gaze shifts.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study did not find evidence of atypical pupillary reactivity to child-directed speech early in life in autism. Instead, the results suggest that certain nonsocial sounds elicit atypically strong alerting responses in infants with a subsequent autism diagnosis. These findings may have important theoretical and clinical implications.},

	Abstract = {<b>Background:</b> Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD or autism) is characterized by difficulties in social communication and interaction, which negatively impact on individuals and their families' quality of life. Currently no pharmacological interventions have been shown to be effective for improving social communication in autism. Previous trials have indicated the potential of arbaclofen for improving social function among autistic children and adolescents with fluent speech. The AIMS2TRIALS-Clinical Trial 1 (AIMS-CT1) will examine whether arbaclofen is superior to placebo in improving social function and other secondary outcomes over 16 weeks, along with safety and tolerability profiles. <b>Methods:</b> AIMS-CT1 is an international, multi-site, double-blind, parallel group Phase II randomized clinical trial. It will include 130 males and females aged 5:0-17:11 years, with a diagnosis of ASD and fluent speech. Eligible participants will be randomized on a ratio of 1:1 for a 16-week treatment period. Medication will be titrated over 5 weeks. The primary outcome is the effect on social function from weeks 0 to 16 measured on the Socialization domain of the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, 3rd edition<sup>TM</sup>. Secondary outcome measures include the CGI-S (Clinical Global Impression-Severity), CGI-I (Clinical Global Impression-Improvement), other areas of adaptive function, social communication and other autism symptoms, co-occurring behavior problems and health-related quality of life. Genetic and electrophysiological markers will be examined as potential stratifiers for treatment response. Exploratory novel digital technologies will also be used to measure change, examining simultaneously the validity of digital biomarkers in natural environments. The safety and tolerability of the drug will also be examined. Our protocol is very closely aligned with a parallel Canadian trial of 90 participants (ARBA Study, US NCT number: NCT03887676) to allow for secondary combined analyses. Outcomes will be compared using both an Intent-to-reat and Per Protocol approach. <b>Discussion:</b> The outcomes of this trial, combined with the parallel Canadian trial, will contribute to the evidence base for medications used to help social difficulties among young autistic individuals; demonstrate the capabilities of the AIMS-2-TRIALS network of academic centers to deliver clinical trials; and support future drug development. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> EudraCT number: 2018-000942-21 and ClinicalTrials.gov registry number: NCT03682978. Currently under protocol v.7.2, dated 20.11.2020.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of neurodevelopmental conditions associated with quantitative differences in cortical and subcortical brain morphometry. Qualitative assessment of brain morphology provides complementary information on the possible underlying neurobiology. Studies of neuroradiological findings in ASD have rendered mixed results, and await robust replication in a sizable and independent sample.<h4>Methods</h4>We systematically and comprehensively assessed neuroradiological findings in a large cohort of participants with ASD and age-matched controls (total N = 620, 348 ASD and 272 controls), including 70 participants with intellectual disability (47 ASD, 23 controls). We developed a comprehensive scoring system, augmented by standardized biometric measures.<h4>Results</h4>There was a higher incidence of neuroradiological findings in individuals with ASD (89.4 %) compared to controls (83.8 %, p = .042). Certain findings were also more common in ASD, in particular opercular abnormalities (OR 1.9, 95 % CI 1.3-3.6) and mega cisterna magna (OR 2.4, 95 % CI 1.4-4.0) reached significance when using FDR, whereas increases in macrocephaly (OR 2.0, 95 % CI 1.2-3.2), cranial deformities (OR 2.4, 95 % CI: 1.0-5.8), calvarian / dural thickening (OR 1.5, 95 % CI 1.0-2.3), ventriculomegaly (OR 3.4, 95 % CI 1.3-9.2), and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum (OR 2.7, 95 % CI 1.1-6.3) did not survive this correction. Furthermore, neuroradiological findings were more likely to occur in isolation in controls, whereas they clustered more frequently in ASD. The incidence of neuroradiological findings was higher in individuals with mild intellectual disability (95.7 %), irrespective of ASD diagnosis.<h4>Conclusion</h4>There was a subtly higher prevalence of neuroradiological findings in ASD, which did not appear to be specific to the condition. Individual findings or clusters of findings may point towards the neurodevelopmental mechanisms involved in individual cases. As such, clinical MRI assessments may be useful to guide further etiopathological (genetic) investigations, and are potentially valuable to fundamental ASD research.},

	Abstract = {Most individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-a complex, life-long developmental disorder-do not have access to the care required to address their diverse health needs. Here, we review: (1) common barriers to healthcare access (shortage/cost of services; physician awareness; stigma); (2) barriers encountered primarily during childhood (limited screening/diagnosis; unclear referral pathways), transition to adulthood (insufficient healthcare transition services; suboptimal physician awareness of healthcare needs) and adulthood (shortage of services/limited insurance; communication difficulties with physicians; limited awareness of healthcare needs of aging adults); and (3) advances in research/program development for better healthcare access. A robust understanding of barriers to accessing healthcare across the lifespan of autistic individuals is critical to ensuring the best use of healthcare resources to improve social, physical, and mental health outcomes. Stakeholders must strengthen healthcare service provision by coming together to: better understand healthcare needs of underserved populations; strengthen medical training on care of autistic individuals; increase public awareness of ASD; promote research into/uptake of tools for ASD screening, diagnosis, and treatment; understand specific healthcare needs of autistic individuals in lower resource countries; and conduct longitudinal studies to understand the lifetime health, social, and economic impacts of ASD and enable the evaluation of novel approaches to increasing healthcare access. IMPACT: Despite the growing body of evidence, our understanding of barriers to healthcare encountered by individuals with ASD remains limited, particularly beyond childhood and in lower resource countries. We describe current and emerging barriers to healthcare access encountered by individuals with ASD across the lifespan. We recommend that stakeholders develop evidence-informed policies, programs, and technologies that address barriers to healthcare access for individuals with ASD and consider broad, equitable implementation to maximize impact.},

	Abstract = {During speech processing, neural activity in non-autistic adults and infants tracks the speech envelope. Recent research in adults indicates that this neural tracking relates to linguistic knowledge and may be reduced in autism. Such reduced tracking, if present already in infancy, could impede language development. In the current study, we focused on children with a family history of autism, who often show a delay in first language acquisition. We investigated whether differences in tracking of sung nursery rhymes during infancy relate to language development and autism symptoms in childhood. We assessed speech-brain coherence at either 10 or 14 months of age in a total of 22 infants with high likelihood of autism due to family history and 19 infants without family history of autism. We analyzed the relationship between speech-brain coherence in these infants and their vocabulary at 24 months as well as autism symptoms at 36 months. Our results showed significant speech-brain coherence in the 10- and 14-month-old infants. We found no evidence for a relationship between speech-brain coherence and later autism symptoms. Importantly, speech-brain coherence in the stressed syllable rate (1-3 Hz) predicted later vocabulary. Follow-up analyses showed evidence for a relationship between tracking and vocabulary only in 10-month-olds but not in 14-month-olds and indicated possible differences between the likelihood groups. Thus, early tracking of sung nursery rhymes is related to language development in childhood.},

	Abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition diagnosed in approximately 2% of children. Reliance on the emergence of clinically observable behavioral patterns only delays the mean age of diagnosis to approximately 4 years. However, neural pathways critical to language and social functions develop during infancy, and current diagnostic protocols miss the age when therapy would be most effective. We developed non-invasive ASD biomarkers using mass spectrometry analyses of elemental metabolism in single hair strands, coupled with machine learning. We undertook a national prospective study in Japan, where hair samples were collected at 1 month and clinical diagnosis was undertaken at 4 years. Next, we analyzed a national sample of Swedish twins and, in our third study, participants from a specialist ASD center in the US. In a blinded analysis, a predictive algorithm detected ASD risk as early as 1 month with 96.4% sensitivity, 75.4% specificity, and 81.4% accuracy (<i>n</i> = 486; 175 cases). These findings emphasize that the dynamics in elemental metabolism are systemically dysregulated in autism, and these signatures can be detected and leveraged in hair samples to predict the emergence of ASD as early as 1 month of age.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Autistic people with co-occurring attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) appear to be at heightened risk of suicide. To understand why, we explored two explanatory mechanisms from the interpersonal theory of suicide: first, that co-occurring ADHD might be associated with greater risk through greater thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness and, secondly, that hyperactive/impulsive features might incur additional risk through their association with painful and provocative events, which are suggested to create "capability" for suicide.<h4>Methods</h4>Autistic adults (<i>n</i> = 314) completed an online survey including measures of thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, painful and provocative events, acquired capability for suicide, and ADHD features. Creating an overall index of likely ADHD, we examined associations between likely ADHD, suicide ideation, and lifetime suicide attempts through the parallel mediators of thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, anxiety, and depression. In several models, we then examined hyperactive, impulsive, and inattentive features as predictors of exposure to painful and provocative events and subsequent capability for suicide, and examined whether these two variables, sequentially or individually, mediated an association with lifetime suicide attempts.<h4>Results</h4>Likely ADHD was associated with past-year suicide ideation through greater depression and perceived burdensomeness, which also mediated its association with more suicide attempts. Hyperactive and impulsive features were associated with exposure to painful and provocative events and through this acquired suicide capability. Both features were associated with more numerous suicide attempts through these two mediators sequentially, and through exposure to painful and provocative events alone.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These data suggest that suicidality in autistic people with ADHD may be partially related to perceived burdensomeness and to acquired suicide capability after exposure to painful and provocative events. However, as we observed a pathway to suicidality associated with painful and provocative events alone, it is likely that there are also other explanatory mechanisms for the influence of traumatic events on suicide risk.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>To understand the emergence of symptoms in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), we need to identify the mechanisms that underpin the development of core social skills. Mounting evidence indicates that young children with later ASD attend less to other people, which could compromise learning opportunities with cascading effects. Passive looking behaviour does not tell us about engagement with visual information, but measures of physiological arousal can provide information on the depth of engagement. In the current study, we use heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) to measure engagement with social dynamic stimuli in ASD.<h4>Methods</h4>Sixty-seven preschoolers with ASD and 65 typical developing preschoolers between 2 and 4 years of age participated in a study where HR was measured during viewing of social and non-social videos. Using latent profile analyses, more homogeneous subgroups of children were created based on phenotype and physiology.<h4>Results</h4>Preschool-aged children with ASD, regardless of their non-verbal, verbal and social competencies, do not differ in overall HR or HRV compared to TD children. However, the ASD group showed a larger increase in HR (more disengagement) than the TD group to later-presented social stimuli. Phenotypic and physiological profiles showed this was primarily the case for children with below average verbal and non-verbal skills, but not necessarily those with more ASD symptoms.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Children with ASD, especially a subgroup showing moderate cognitive delays, show an increase in HR to social stimuli over time; this may reflect difficulties re-engaging with social information when attention is waning.},

It is unclear whether this might be partly explained by symptoms of anxiety and/or depression, which affect at least 20%-50% of autistic people. In this study, we measured individual differences in well-being in 573 six to thirty-year-olds with and without a diagnosis of autism. We investigated whether individual differences in well-being were explained by autism traits (e.g. social-communication difficulties) and/or anxiety and depression symptoms. We showed that, though well-being was lower for some autistic individuals, compared to those without autism, many autistic individuals reported good well-being. Where well-being was reduced, this was particularly explained by depression symptoms, across all ages. For children/adolescents, anxiety and social-communication difficulties were also related to some aspects of well-being. Our study suggests that support and services for improving mental health, especially depression symptoms, may also improve broader outcomes for autistic people.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Lay abstract</h4>Sex-steroids, such as testosterone, are thought to be one of the biological factors implicated in autism. This relies on the sex bias in the diagnosis of autism (boys are approximately four times more likely to be diagnosed than girls) and findings of associations with fetal testosterone levels in traits and abilities related to autism. The current study aimed to examine the association between medical conditions and physical symptoms, which tend to manifest in adulthood, and autism in females. Moreover, we examined their association with autistic traits throughout the spectrum. We focused on autistic women because there is little research focusing on the healthcare needs of autistic women, but those that exist suggest heightened vulnerability, and lower access to medical care. We find that conditions related to steroid hormones function are more frequent in autistic women and that they correlate with autistic traits. Specifically, we found that body mass index, reproductive system diagnoses, prediabetes symptoms, irregular puberty onset, and menstrual irregularities were significantly more frequent in autistic women and were significantly correlated with autistic traits in neurotypical women. The findings have important implications for raising awareness in autistic women of the possibility of medical conditions which might need medical attention. In addition, healthcare providers should consider these associations when performing healthcare maintenance checks and/or screening for autism.},

	Abstract = {Small average differences in the left-right asymmetry of cerebral cortical thickness have been reported in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared to typically developing controls, affecting widespread cortical regions. The possible impacts of these regional alterations in terms of structural network effects have not previously been characterized. Inter-regional morphological covariance analysis can capture network connectivity between different cortical areas at the macroscale level. Here, we used cortical thickness data from 1455 individuals with ASD and 1560 controls, across 43 independent datasets of the ENIGMA consortium's ASD Working Group, to assess hemispheric asymmetries of intra-individual structural covariance networks, using graph theory-based topological metrics. Compared with typical features of small-world architecture in controls, the ASD sample showed significantly altered average asymmetry of networks involving the fusiform, rostral middle frontal, and medial orbitofrontal cortex, involving higher randomization of the corresponding right-hemispheric networks in ASD. A network involving the superior frontal cortex showed decreased right-hemisphere randomization. Based on comparisons with meta-analyzed functional neuroimaging data, the altered connectivity asymmetry particularly affected networks that subserve executive functions, language-related and sensorimotor processes. These findings provide a network-level characterization of altered left-right brain asymmetry in ASD, based on a large combined sample. Altered asymmetrical brain development in ASD may be partly propagated among spatially distant regions through structural connectivity.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Sleep disorders are one of the most common problems in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). However, they often tend to be underdiagnosed and incorrectly treated in clinical practice. This study aims to identify sleep disorders in preschool children with ASD and to explore their relationship with the core symptoms of autism, the child's developmental and cognitive level as well as the psychiatric comorbidities.<h4>Methods</h4>We recruited 163 preschool children with a diagnosis of ASD. The Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) assessed sleep conditions. Multiple standardized tests were used to evaluate intellectual abilities, the presence of repetitive behaviors (through the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised), as well as the emotional-behavioral problems and the psychiatric comorbidities (through the Child Behavior Checklist -CBCL 1<sup>1/2</sup>-5).<h4>Results</h4>The results showed that poor disorders had consistently higher scores in all areas assessed by the CSHQ and on the CBCL across all domains. The correlational analysis showed that severe sleep disorders were associated with higher scores in internalizing, externalizing, and total problems at the CBCL syndromic scales, and in all DSM-oriented CBCL subscales. Moreover, we found that the association between sleep disorders and restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRBs) is explained by the anxiety-related symptoms.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Based on these findings, the study recommends that screening for sleep problems followed by early intervention should constitute a routine part of clinical practice for children with ASD.},

As an alternative to these barriers, the SCOPE project presents a new, easy accessible and blended intervention called BEAR (Blended E-health for children at eArly Risk). This paper describes this BEAR intervention and study design of an ongoing two arm cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT).<h4>Methods</h4>BEAR (Blended E-health for children at eArly Risk) is a blended e-health intervention, based on evidence-based naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions (NDBI's) and can be offered to parents and infants/toddlers at high likelihood for ASD. During the ongoing RCT, N = 88 high risk infants and toddlers will be cluster randomized over the BEAR intervention and care-as-usual (CAU) conditions. The finalized version of the intervention protocol and study design are presented in this paper. The primary outcome measure is joint engagement measured by the Joint Engagement Rating Inventory (JERI) during videotaped parent-child interaction. Secondary outcome measures include severity of ASD symptoms, global level of adaptive functioning, parental well-being, parental skills and satisfaction with healthcare. Also, costs will be estimated from society's perspective. Assessments take place at the start of the study (T1), after eight weeks (T2) and after six months (T3) and include behavioral home observations and parental questionnaires.<h4>Discussion</h4>The SCOPE project aims to contribute to improved early identification and timely start of suitable interventions for infants and toddlers at elevated likelihood for ASD. This ongoing RCT will offer insight in the feasibility, short-term and six months effects of the innovative BEAR intervention. It is estimated that inclusion for the trial (N = 88) is completed in spring 2023.<h4>Trial registration</h4>Dutch Trial Register, NTR7695.

	Abstract = {Structural brain alterations in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are heterogeneous, with limited effect sizes overall. In this study, we aimed to identify subgroups in ASD, based on neuroanatomical profiles; we hypothesized that the effect sizes for case/control differences would be increased in the newly defined subgroups. Analyzing a large data set from the ENIGMA-ASD working group (n = 2661), we applied exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to seven subcortical volumes of individuals with and without ASD to uncover the underlying organization of subcortical structures. Based on earlier findings and data availability, we focused on three age groups: boys (<=14 years), male adolescents (15-22 years), and adult men (> = 22 years). The resulting factor scores were used in a community detection (CD) analysis to cluster participants into subgroups. Three factors were found in each subsample; the factor structure in adult men differed from that in boys and male adolescents. From these factors, CD uncovered four distinct communities in boys and three communities in adolescents and adult men, irrespective of ASD diagnosis. The effect sizes for case/control comparisons were more pronounced than in the combined sample, for some communities. A significant group difference in ADOS scores between communities was observed in boys and male adolescents with ASD. We succeeded in stratifying participants into more homogeneous subgroups based on subcortical brain volumes. This stratification enhanced our ability to observe case/control differences in subcortical brain volumes in ASD, and may help to explain the heterogeneity of previous findings in ASD. LAY SUMMARY: Structural brain alterations in ASD are heterogeneous, with overall limited effect sizes. Here we aimed to identify subgroups in ASD based on neuroimaging measures. We tested whether the effect sizes for case/control differences would be increased in the newly defined subgroups. Based on neuroanatomical profiles, we succeeded in stratifying our participants into more homogeneous subgroups. The effect sizes of case/control differences were more pronounced in some subgroups than those in the whole sample.},

	Abstract = {Mutations of the postsynaptic scaffold protein Shank2 lead to autism spectrum disorders (ASD). These patients frequently suffer from higher fracture risk. Here, we investigated whether Shank2 directly regulates bone mass. We show that Shank2 is expressed in bone and that Shank2 levels are increased during osteoblastogenesis. Knockdown of Shank2 by siRNA targeting the encoding regions for <i>PDZ</i> and <i>SAM</i> domain inhibits osteoblastogenesis of primary murine calvarial osteoblasts. Shank2 knockout mice (<i>Shank2</i> <sup>-/-</sup>) have a decreased bone mass due to reduced osteoblastogenesis and bone formation, whereas bone resorption remains unaffected. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-derived osteoblasts from a loss-of-function Shank2 mutation in a patient showed a significantly reduced osteoblast differentiation potential. Moreover, silencing of known Shank2 interacting proteins revealed that a majority of them promote osteoblast differentiation. From this we conclude that Shank2 and interacting proteins known from the central nervous system are decisive regulators in osteoblast differentiation. © 2022 The Authors. <i>JBMR Plus</i> published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4> Autism traits emerge between the ages of 1 and 2. It is not known if experiences which increase the likelihood of childhood autism are related to early trait emergence, or if other exposures are more important. Identifying factors linked to toddler autism traits in the general population may improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying atypical neurodevelopment. <h4>Methods</h4> Clinical, socio-demographic, and parental information was collected at birth from 536 toddlers in London, UK (gestational age at birth, sex, maternal body mass index, age, parental education level, parental first language, parental history of neurodevelopmental disorders) and at 18 months (parent cohabiting status, two measures of social deprivation, three measures of maternal parenting style, and a measure of maternal postnatal depression). General neurodevelopment was assessed with the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3 rd Edition (BSID-III), and autism traits were assessed using the Quantitative Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (Q-CHAT). Multivariable models were used to identify associations between variables and Q-CHAT. A model including BSID-III was used to identify factors associated with Q-CHAT independent of general neurodevelopment. Models were also evaluated addressing variable collinearity with principal component analysis (PCA). <h4>Results</h4> A multivariable model explained 20% of Q-CHAT variance, with four individually significant variables (two measures of parenting style and two measures of socio-economic deprivation). After adding general neurodevelopment into the model 36% of Q-CHAT variance was explained, with three individually significant variables (two measures of parenting style and one measure of language development). After addressing variable collinearity with PCA, parenting style and social deprivation were positively correlated with Q-CHAT score via a single principal component, independently of general neurodevelopment. Neither sex nor family history of autism were associated with Q-CHAT score. <h4>Limitations</h4> The Q-CHAT is parent rated and is therefore a subjective opinion rather than a clinical assessment. We measured Q-CHAT at a single timepoint, and to date no participant has been followed up in later childhood, so we are focused purely on emerging traits rather than clinical autism diagnoses. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Autism traits are common at age 18 months, and greater emergence is specifically related to exposure to early life adversity.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>SHANKs are major scaffolding proteins at postsynaptic densities (PSDs) in the central nervous system. Mutations in all three family members have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Despite the pathophysiological importance of SHANK2 and SHANK3 mutations in humans, research on the expression of these proteins is mostly based on rodent model organisms.<h4>Results</h4>In the present study, cellular and neuropil SHANK2 expression was analyzed by immunofluorescence (IF) staining of post mortem human brain tissue from four male individuals (19 brain regions). Mouse brains were analyzed in comparison to evaluate the degree of phylogenetic conservation. Furthermore, SHANK2 and SHANK3 isoform patterns were compared in human and mouse brain lysates. While isoform expression and subcellular distribution were largely conserved, differences in neuropil levels of SHANK2 were found by IF staining: Maximum expression was concordantly measured in the cerebellum; however, higher SHANK2 expression was detected in the human brainstem and thalamus when compared to mice. One of the lowest SHANK2 levels was found in the human amygdala, a moderately expressing region in mouse. Quantification of SHANK3 IF in mouse brains unveiled a distribution comparable to humans.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In summary, these data show that the overall expression pattern of SHANK is largely conserved in defined brain regions; however, differences do exist, which need to be considered in the translation of rodent studies. The summarized expression patterns of SHANK2 and SHANK3 should serve as a reference for future studies.},

	Abstract = {Identifying structural measures that capture early brain development and are sensitive to individual differences in behavior is a priority in developmental neuroscience, with potential implications for our understanding of both typical and atypical populations. T1-weighted/T2-weighted (T1w/T2w) ratio mapping, which previously has been linked to myelination, represents an interesting candidate measure in this respect, as an accessible measure from standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences. Yet, its value as an early infancy measure remains largely unexplored. Here, we compared T1w/T2w ratio in 5-month-old infants at familial risk (n = 27) for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to those without elevated autism risk (n = 16). We found lower T1w/T2w ratio in infants at high risk for ASD within widely distributed regions, spanning both white and gray matter. In regions differing between groups, higher T1w/T2w ratio was robustly associated with higher age at scan (range: ~ 4-6.5 months), implying sensitivity to maturation at short developmental timescales. Further, higher T1w/T2w ratio within these regions was associated with higher scores on measures of concurrent developmental level. These findings suggest that T1w/T2w ratio is a developmentally sensitive measure that should be explored further in future studies of both typical and atypical infant populations.},

A total of 344 twins (172 pairs; mean age 15.56 ± 5.62 years) enriched for ASD and other neurodevelopmental conditions were examined. Medical history and current physical problems were collected with a validated questionnaire to determine twin's somatic health. The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2) was used to measure the participant's severity of autistic traits. Identified somatic health issues with significant within-twin pair differences were tested in relation to both ASD diagnosis and autistic traits in a co-twin control model. Twins with ASD exhibited more neurological and immunological health problems compared to those without ASD (p = 0.005 and p = 0.004, respectively). The intra-pair differences of neurological conditions and SRS-2 score were significantly correlated in monozygotic twins differing for autism traits (r = 0.40, p = 0.001), while the correlation was not found for immunological problems. In addition, a conditional model for analysis of within-twin pair effects revealed an association between neurological problems and clinical ASD diagnosis (Odds ratio per neurological problem 3.15, p = 0.02), as well as autistic traits (β = 10.44, p = 0.006), after adjusting for possible effects of co-existing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and general intellectual abilities. Our findings suggest that neurological problems are associated with autism, and that non-shared environmental factors contribute to the overlap for both clinical ASD and autistic traits. Further population-based twin studies are warranted to validate our results and examine in detailed the shared genetic and environmental contributions of neurological problems and ASD.},

Here, we aimed to elucidate the relationship between autism and typical sex-differential neuroanatomy, cognition, and related gene expression. <h4>Methods</h4> Using a novel deep learning framework trained to predict biological sex, we compared sex prediction model performance across neurotypical and autistic males and females. Multiple large-scale datasets were employed at different stages of the analysis pipeline: a) Pre-training: the UK Biobank sample (>10.000 individuals); b) Transfer learning and validation: the ABIDE datasets (1,412 individuals, 5-56 years of age); c) Test and discovery: the EU-AIMS/AIMS-2-TRIALS LEAP dataset (681 individuals, 6-30 years of age) and d) Specificity: the Neuroimage and ADHD200 datasets (887 individuals, 7-26 years of age). <h4>Results</h4> Across both ABIDE and LEAP we showed that features positively predictive of neurotypical males were on average more predictive of autistic males ( P =1.1e-23). Features positively predictive of neurotypical females were on average less predictive of autistic females ( P =1.2e-22). These accuracy differences in autism were not observed in individuals with ADHD. In autistic females the male-shifted neurophenotype was further associated with poorer social sensitivity and emotional face processing while also with associated gene expression patterns of midgestational cell types. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Our results demonstrate a shift in both autistic male and female individuals’ neuroanatomy towards male-characteristic patterns associated with typically sex-differential, social cognitive features and related gene expression patterns.

This ability is called joint attention and facilitates social learning and language development. Although children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are known to engage less in joint attention compared to other children, several experimental studies have shown that they follow other's gaze (a requirement for visual joint attention) to the same extent as other children. In this study, infants' eye movements were measured at age 10, 14, and 18 months while watching another person look in a certain direction. A target object was either present or absent in the direction of the other person's gaze. Some of the infants were at elevated likelihood of ASD, due to having an older autistic sibling. At age 3 years, infants were assessed for a diagnosis of ASD. Results showed that infants who met diagnostic criteria at 3 years followed gaze to the same extent as other infants. However, they then looked back at the model faster than typically developing infants <i>when no target object was present</i>. When a target object was present, there was no difference between groups. These results may be in line with the view that directly after gaze following, infants with later ASD are less influenced by other people's gaze when processing the common attentional focus. The study adds to our understanding of both the similarities and differences in looking behaviors between infants who later receive an ASD diagnosis and other infants.},

Here, we model GI development using 3D intestinal organoids grown under zinc-restricted conditions. We found significant morphological alterations. Using proteomic approaches, we identified biological processes affected by zinc deficiency that regulate barrier permeability and pro-inflammatory pathways. We confirmed our results in vivo through proteomics studies and investigating GI development in zinc-deficient mice. These show altered GI physiology and pro-inflammatory signaling, resulting in chronic systemic and neuroinflammation, and gut microbiota composition similar to that reported in human ASD cases. Thus, low zinc status during development is sufficient to compromise intestinal barrier integrity and activate pro-inflammatory signaling, resulting in changes in microbiota composition that may aggravate inflammation, altogether mimicking the co-morbidities frequently observed in ASD.},

The condition is characterised by global developmental delay, ID, speech impairments, hypotonia and autistic behaviours, although its presentation and symptom severity vary widely. In this study, we provide a thorough description of the behavioural profile in PMS and explore differences related to deletion size and language ability.<h4>Methods</h4>We used standard clinical assessment instruments to measure altered behaviour, adaptive skills and autistic symptomatology in sixty participants with PMS (30 females, median age 8.5 years, SD=7.1). We recorded background information and other clinical manifestations and explored associations with deletion size. We performed descriptive and inferential analyses for group comparison.<h4>Results</h4>We found delayed gross and fine motor development, delayed and impaired language (~70% of participants non or minimally verbal), ID of different degrees and adaptive functioning ranging from severe to borderline impairment. Approximately 40% of participants experienced developmental regression, and half of those regained skills. Autistic symptoms were frequent and variable in severity, with a median ADOS-2 CSS score of 6 for every domain. Sensory processing anomalies, hyperactivity, attentional problems and medical comorbidities were commonplace. The degree of language and motor development appeared to be associated with deletion size.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study adds to previous research on the clinical descriptions of PMS and supports results suggesting wide variability of symptom severity and its association with deletion size. It makes the case for suitable psychotherapeutic and pharmacological approaches, for longitudinal studies to strengthen our understanding of possible clinical courses and for more precise genomic analysis.},

	Abstract = {Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition associated with atypical social communication, cognitive, and sensory faculties. Recent advances in exposure biology suggest that biomarkers of elemental uptake and metabolism measured in hair samples can yield an effective signal predictive of autism diagnosis. Here, we investigated if elemental biomarkers in hair were associated with functional connectivity in regions of the default mode network (DMN) previously linked to autism. In a study sample which included twin pairs with concordant and discordant diagnoses for autism, our analysis of hair samples and neuroimaging data supported two general findings. First, independent of autism diagnosis, we found a broad pattern of association between elemental biomarkers and functional connectivity in the DMN, which primarily involved dynamics in zinc metabolism. Second, we found that associations between the DMN and elemental biomarkers, particularly involving phosphorus, calcium, manganese, and magnesium, differed significantly in autistic participants from control participants. In sum, these findings suggest that functional dynamics in elemental metabolism relate broadly to persistent patterns of functional connectivity in the DMN, and that these associations are altered in the emergence of autism.},

	Abstract = {Sensory differences between autism and neuro-typical populations are well-documented and have often been explained by either weak-central-coherence or excitation/inhibition-imbalance cortical theories. We tested these theories with perceptual multi-stability paradigms in which dissimilar images presented to each eye generate dynamic cyclopean percepts based on ongoing cortical grouping and suppression processes. We studied perceptual multi-stability with Interocular Grouping (IOG), which requires the simultaneous integration and suppression of image fragments from both eyes, and Conventional Binocular Rivalry (CBR), which only requires global suppression of either eye, in 17 autistic adults and 18 neurotypical participants. We used a Hidden-Markov-Model as tool to analyze the multistable dynamics of these processes. Overall, the dynamics of multi-stable perception were slower (i.e. there were longer durations and fewer transitions among perceptual states) in the autistic group compared to the neurotypical group for both IOG and CBR. The weighted Markovian transition distributions revealed key differences between both groups and paradigms. The results indicate overall lower levels of suppression and decreased levels of grouping in autistic than neurotypical participants, consistent with elements of excitation/inhibition imbalance and weak-central-coherence theories.},

	Abstract = {An increasing number of large-scale multi-modal research initiatives has been conducted in the typically developing population, e.g. Dev. Cogn. Neur. 32:43-54, 2018; PLoS Med. 12(3):e1001779, 2015; Elam and Van Essen, Enc. Comp. Neur., 2013, as well as in psychiatric cohorts, e.g. Trans. Psych. 10(1):100, 2020; Mol. Psych. 19:659-667, 2014; Mol. Aut. 8:24, 2017; Eur. Child and Adol. Psych. 24(3):265-281, 2015. Missing data is a common problem in such datasets due to the difficulty of assessing multiple measures on a large number of participants. The consequences of missing data accumulate when researchers aim to integrate relationships across multiple measures. Here we aim to evaluate different imputation strategies to fill in missing values in clinical data from a large (total N = 764) and deeply phenotyped (i.e. range of clinical and cognitive instruments administered) sample of N = 453 autistic individuals and N = 311 control individuals recruited as part of the EU-AIMS Longitudinal European Autism Project (LEAP) consortium. In particular, we consider a total of 160 clinical measures divided in 15 overlapping subsets of participants. We use two simple but common univariate strategies-mean and median imputation-as well as a Round Robin regression approach involving four independent multivariate regression models including Bayesian Ridge regression, as well as several non-linear models: Decision Trees (Extra Trees., and Nearest Neighbours regression. We evaluate the models using the traditional mean square error towards removed available data, and also consider the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the observed and the imputed distributions. We show that all of the multivariate approaches tested provide a substantial improvement compared to typical univariate approaches. Further, our analyses reveal that across all 15 data-subsets tested, an Extra Trees regression approach provided the best global results. This not only allows the selection of a unique model to impute missing data for the LEAP project and delivers a fixed set of imputed clinical data to be used by researchers working with the LEAP dataset in the future, but provides more general guidelines for data imputation in large scale epidemiological studies.},

	Abstract = {Flexible behavior is critical for everyday decision-making and has been implicated in restricted, repetitive behaviors (RRB) in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, how flexible behavior changes developmentally in ASD remains largely unknown. Here, we used a developmental approach and examined flexible behavior on a probabilistic reversal learning task in 572 children, adolescents, and adults (ASD N = 321; typical development [TD] N = 251). Using computational modeling, we quantified latent variables that index mechanisms underlying perseveration and feedback sensitivity. We then assessed these variables in relation to diagnosis, developmental stage, core autism symptomatology, and associated psychiatric symptoms. Autistic individuals showed on average more perseveration and less feedback sensitivity than TD individuals, and, across cases and controls, older age groups showed more feedback sensitivity than younger age groups. Computational modeling revealed that dominant learning mechanisms underpinning flexible behavior differed across developmental stages and reduced flexible behavior in ASD was driven by less optimal learning on average within each age group. In autistic children, perseverative errors were positively related to anxiety symptoms, and in autistic adults, perseveration (indexed by both task errors and model parameter estimates) was positively related to RRB. These findings provide novel insights into reduced flexible behavior in relation to clinical symptoms in ASD.},

	Abstract = {Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition affecting ∼1% of the population. Recently, machine learning models have been trained to classify participants with autism using their neuroimaging features, though the performance of these models varies in the literature. Differences in experimental setup hamper the direct comparison of different machine-learning approaches. In this paper, five of the most widely used and best-performing machine learning models in the field were trained to classify participants with autism and typically developing (TD) participants, using functional connectivity matrices, structural volumetric measures and phenotypic information from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) dataset. Their performance was compared under the same evaluation standard. The models implemented included: graph convolutional networks (GCN), edge-variational graph convolutional networks (EV-GCN), fully connected networks (FCN), auto-encoder followed by a fully connected network (AE-FCN) and support vector machine (SVM). Our results show that all models performed similarly, achieving a classification accuracy around 70%. Our results suggest that different inclusion criteria, data modalities and evaluation pipelines rather than different machine learning models may explain variations in accuracy in published literature. The highest accuracy in our framework was obtained by an ensemble of GCN models trained on combination of functional MRI and structural MRI features, reaching classification accuracy of 72.2% and AUC = 0.78 on the test set. The combined structural and functional modalities exhibited higher predictive ability compared to using single modality features alone. Ensemble methods were found to be helpful to improve the performance of the models. Furthermore, we also investigated the stability of features identified by the different machine learning models using the SmoothGrad interpretation method. The FCN model demonstrated the highest stability selecting relevant features contributing to model decision making. Code available at: https://github.com/YilanDong19/Machine-learning-with-ABIDE .},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Uncovering the neural mechanisms that underlie symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) requires studying brain development prior to the emergence of behavioural difficulties. One new approach to this is prospective studies of infants with an elevated likelihood of developing ADHD.<h4>Methods</h4>We used a prospective design to examine an oscillatory electroencephalography profile that has been widely studied in both children and adults with ADHD - the balance between lower and higher frequencies operationalised as the theta-beta ratio (TBR). In the present study, we examined TBR in 136 10-month-old infants (72 male and 64 female) with/without an elevated likelihood of developing ADHD and/or a comparison disorder (Autism Spectrum Disorder; ASD).<h4>Results</h4>Infants with a first-degree relative with ADHD demonstrated lower TBR than infants without a first-degree relative with ADHD. Further, lower TBR at 10 months was positively associated with temperament dimensions conceptually related to ADHD at 2 years. TBR was not altered in infants with a family history of ASD.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This is the first demonstration that alterations in TBR are present prior to behavioural symptoms of ADHD. However, these alterations manifest differently than those sometimes observed in older children with an ADHD diagnosis. Importantly, altered TBR was not seen in infants at elevated likelihood of developing ASD, suggesting a degree of specificity to ADHD. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that there are brain changes associated with a family history of ADHD observable in the first year of life.},

	Abstract = {Synaptic gene conditions, i.e., "synaptopathies," involve disruption to genes expressed at the synapse and account for between 0.5 and 2% of autism cases. They provide a unique entry point to understanding the molecular and biological mechanisms underpinning autism-related phenotypes. Phelan-McDermid Syndrome (PMS, also known as 22q13 deletion syndrome) and <i>NRXN1</i> deletions (NRXN1ds) are two synaptopathies associated with autism and related neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). PMS often incorporates disruption to the <i>SHANK3</i> gene, implicated in excitatory postsynaptic scaffolding, whereas the <i>NRXN1</i> gene encodes neurexin-1, a presynaptic cell adhesion protein; both are implicated in <i>trans</i>-synaptic signaling in the brain. Around 70% of individuals with PMS and 43-70% of those with NRXN1ds receive a diagnosis of autism, suggesting that alterations in synaptic development may play a crucial role in explaining the aetiology of autism. However, a substantial amount of heterogeneity exists between conditions. Most individuals with PMS have moderate to profound intellectual disability (ID), while those with NRXN1ds have no ID to severe ID. Speech abnormalities are common to both, although appear more severe in PMS. Very little is currently known about the neurocognitive underpinnings of phenotypic presentations in PMS and NRXN1ds. The Synaptic Gene (SynaG) study adopts a gene-first approach and comprehensively assesses these two syndromic forms of autism. The study compliments preclinical efforts within AIMS-2-TRIALS focused on <i>SHANK3</i> and <i>NRXN1</i>. The aims of the study are to (1) establish the frequency of autism diagnosis and features in individuals with PMS and NRXN1ds, (2) to compare the clinical profile of PMS, NRXN1ds, and individuals with 'idiopathic' autism (iASD), (3) to identify mechanistic biomarkers that may account for autistic features and/or heterogeneity in clinical profiles, and (4) investigate the impact of second or multiple genetic hits on heterogeneity in clinical profiles. In the current paper we describe our methodology for phenotyping the sample and our planned comparisons, with information on the necessary adaptations made during the global COVID-19 pandemic. We also describe the demographics of the data collected thus far, including 25 PMS, 36 NRXN1ds, 33 iASD, and 52 NTD participants, and present an interim analysis of autistic features and adaptive functioning.},

Autistic people may therefore have lower well-being than non-autistic people during this time. We asked autistic and non-autistic people to fill in questionnaires measuring stress, depression, anxiety and satisfaction with life. They were asked to do this once during pregnancy, once 2 to 3 months after giving birth and once 6 months after giving birth. At 6 months after giving birth, they also filled in questionnaires about parenting. The autistic parents had higher stress, depression and anxiety scores than the non-autistic parents. For both groups, scores for anxiety went down over time. There were no differences between the groups on satisfaction with their life or how confident they were as a parent. There were no differences between the groups on most areas of parenting style, although autistic parents scored lower on parenting discipline. This study suggests that autistic people may be more stressed, depressed and anxious than non-autistic people during pregnancy and after giving birth. Autistic people therefore need good quality support during this time. This study also suggests that autistic and non-autistic parents may be just as likely to parent in positive ways such as being sensitive to their baby's needs.},

	Abstract = {<b><i>Background:</i></b> Camouflaging (also referred to as "masking") is a commonly reported strategy used by autistic adults in everyday life to help them cope in social situations. Autistic adults report that camouflaging can have a devastating effect on mental health and well-being, yet little is known about the lived experiences of camouflaging and its impact.<b><i>Methods:</i></b> We designed an online survey in partnership with autistic adults, to explore the experiences of camouflaging and its impact on mental health. Participants self-reported the lifetime experience of camouflaging, where they camouflaged the frequency and length of time spent camouflaging. Four open questions allowed participants to elaborate their answers to the closed questions on frequency and length of time, and subsequently any positive and negative aspects of their experience of camouflaging. Two hundred seventy-seven autistic adults who self-reported a diagnosis of an autism spectrum condition (128 female, 78 male) or self-identified as autistic (56 female, 15 male) were included in the analysis of qualitative responses to the open-ended questions.<b><i>Findings:</i></b> We thematically analyzed participant answers from the open questions. Three main themes emerged. First, "dangers of camouflaging" described how the amount of time spent camouflaging led to exhaustion, isolation, poor mental and physical health, loss of identity and acceptance of self, others' unreal perceptions and expectations, and delayed diagnosis. Second, "positive aspects of camouflaging" included greater access to social spaces, and protection from harm. Camouflaging was, therefore, seen as necessary to survive in a world designed for the neurotypical majority. Third, autistic adults described being diagnosed and accepted for who they are as reasons for "why I don't need to camouflage like I used to."<b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Time spent camouflaging is what seems to be most damaging for the participants' mental health. The main reason reported for needing to spend so much time camouflaging is society's lack of awareness and acceptance of autism.<h4>Lay summary</h4><b>Why is this study being done?:</b> Many autistic adults report that they need to camouflage their autistic behaviors to help them "fit in" and cope in social situations with non-autistic people. This is because society is not as aware and accepting of autistic people as it needs to be. We also know that for most autistic adults camouflaging is exhausting and damaging for their mental health. This study is important, because researchers have not studied camouflaging enough to know what it is like for autistic adults to camouflage in their everyday lives and to understand the impact that camouflaging has on their mental health.<b>What was the purpose of this study?:</b> We wanted to ask autistic adults about their positive and negative experiences of camouflaging. This is important because it will help professionals better understand why autistic adults camouflage, and better support the mental health needs of autistic adults. This increased understanding may also help society become more aware and accepting of autism. If this happens, autistic adults will not need to camouflage as much. Not having to camouflage as much could also help prevent and reduce mental health problems in autistic adults.<b>What did we do?:</b> We asked autistic adults with a clinical diagnosis and those who self-identify as autistic to complete an online survey. The survey asked questions about mental health, self-injury, suicidal thoughts, and suicidal behaviors. One part of the survey asked questions about camouflaging. If research participants said they camouflaged or masked their autistic characteristics to cope with social situations, they would then be asked about when and why they camouflage, and about the positive and negative consequences of camouflaging.<b>What did we find?:</b> We found that autistic people confirmed that they camouflage because of a lack of awareness and acceptance of autism in society. We also found that both autistic males and females camouflage. Although some autistic adults said that "everyone" camouflages, they thought that autistic people spent much more time than non-autistic people camouflaging in their everyday lives. Spending lots of time camouflaging was what was most damaging for autistic adults' mental health. Although most autistic adults thought that camouflaging was damaging to their mental health, some thought that it helped them too.<b>How will knowing this help autistic adults?:</b> Our results suggest that it is important to reduce pressure to camouflage. This could help prevent high rates of mental health problems in autistic people. Our results suggest that this can be achieved if wider society becomes more aware and accepting of autistic people. Our results also suggest that reducing pressure to camouflage could benefit everyone in society.},

	Abstract = {Prenatal testosterone (pT) is a crucial component in physiological masculinization in humans. In line with the Prenatal Sex Steroid Theory of autism, some studies have found a positive correlation between pT and autistic traits in childhood. However, effects in adolescence have not been explored. Hormonal and environmental changes occurring during puberty may alter the strength or the nature of prenatal effects on autistic traits. The current study examines if pT relates to autistic traits in a non-clinical sample of adolescents and young adults (N = 97, 170 observations; age 13-21 years old). It also explores pT interactions with pubertal stage and timing. PT concentrations were measured from amniotic fluid extracted in the 2nd trimester of gestation via amniocentesis conducted for clinical purposes. Autistic traits were measured by self- and parent-reports on the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) which provides a total score and 5 sub-scores (social skills, communication, imagination, attention switching and attention to detail). Self-reported pubertal stage was regressed on age to provide a measure of relative timing. We found no statistical evidence for a direct association between pT and autistic traits in this adolescent sample (males, females or full sample). Exploratory analyses suggested that pT correlated positively with autistic traits in adolescents with earlier puberty-onset, but statistical robustness of this finding was limited. Further exploratory post-hoc tests suggested the pT-by-pubertal timing interaction was stronger in males relative to females, in self-reported compared to parent-reported AQ and specifically for social traits. These findings require replication in larger samples. Findings have implications for understanding the effects of pT on human behavior, specifically existence of effects in adolescence.},

However, the knowledge of mechanisms and phenotypic profiles associated with NSE in ASD is scarce.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic search was conducted using Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO for studies published in English between 1990 and August 2020 using co-twin control design to compare behavioral and biological phenotypes among monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs concordant/discordant for ASD, clinical autism symptoms, or autistic traits. Risk of bias was assessed through a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty six articles were included. Differential DNA methylation and gene expression were found among ASD discordant twins; however, genetic results were inconsistent. Neurological disorders and early medical events were associated with ASD and autistic traits, while no within pair differences were found for minor physical anomalies or head circumference. Structural and functional brain imaging studies and research on social and other cognitive/behavioral functions were inconclusive. Risk of bias assessment found that all studies used the same exposure (or outcome) measures to collect data for participants and most used either secure health-related records or structured interviews for ascertainment of exposure; however, only a handful of studies representative of the population from which they were drawn. Formal assessment of risk of publication bias (i.e., funnel plot) was not possible.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results suggest that NSE in ASD could be associated with heterogeneous postzygotic genetic mechanisms and manifest as a range of biological and behavioral phenotypes. Extant findings were limited by relatively few studies, small sample sizes, and methodological diversity. More research is needed on co-occurring biological and behavioral phenotypes using a consistent format for designing, analyzing, and reporting MZ ASD discordant twin studies in order to further examine the role of NSE in the etiology of ASD.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background: </h4> The field of biomedical research is entering a new era, in which public data sharing is increasingly the norm. There are many advantages of embracing data sharing initiatives, including tackling the replication crisis through enhanced transparency and publication of null findings, facilitating global collaborations to accelerate research progress, enhancing cost-effectiveness by reducing duplication of efforts, and making scientific advances more accessible to the public. However, there are also several crucial ethical and logistical challenges that must be addressed to maximise the benefits of data sharing and minimise risks. The potential, and increasingly recognised, risks of unregulated data sharing (e.g., data reidentification, misuse, and lack of representativeness due to variability in who agrees to share data) have also been exemplified by high profile data breaches and directly clash with efforts to make research more robust, accessible, and global. Methods/Results Here, we narratively outline current challenges for data sharing from the perspective of child and adolescent psychiatry, one area where they may be particularly acute. For example, child and early adolescent research often requires caregivers to consent on behalf of a minor – increasing the responsibility of researchers to consider how the science of today may evolve into the future (when those individuals are no longer minors). We use data from our research consortium Autism Innovative Medicines Study - 2 - Trials (AIMS-2-TRIALS; https://www.aims-2-trials.eu/ ) to illustrate the points raised in this perspective piece. Conclusions We also propose some potential solutions to begin to address current challenges for data sharing, focusing on key priorities, including shared control of data curation between researcher and participant communities and equity of access by research groups to the tools and resources needed to conduct responsible and sustainable data sharing.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>The global COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on European health and social care systems, with demands on testing, hospital and intensive care capacity exceeding available resources in many regions. This has led to concerns that some vulnerable groups, including autistic people, may be excluded from services.<h4>Methods</h4>We reviewed policies from 15 European member states, published in March-July 2020, pertaining to (1) access to COVID-19 tests; (2) provisions for treatment, hospitalisation and intensive care units (ICUs); and (3) changes to standard health and social care. In parallel, we analysed survey data on the lived experiences of 1301 autistic people and caregivers.<h4>Results</h4>Autistic people experienced significant barriers when accessing COVID-19 services. First, despite being at elevated risk of severe illness due to co-occurring health conditions, there was a lack of accessibility of COVID-19 testing. Second, many COVID-19 outpatient and inpatient treatment services were reported to be inaccessible, predominantly resulting from individual differences in communication needs. Third, ICU triage protocols in many European countries (directly or indirectly) resulted in discriminatory exclusion from lifesaving treatments. Finally, interruptions to standard health and social care left over 70% of autistic people without everyday support.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated existing healthcare inequalities for autistic people, probably contributing to disproportionate increases in morbidity and mortality, mental health and behavioural difficulties, and reduced quality of life. An urgent need exists for policies and guidelines on accessibility of COVID-19 services to be updated to prevent the widespread exclusion of autistic people from services, which represents a violation of international human rights law.},

	Abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a high cost neurodevelopmental condition; and there are currently no effective pharmacological treatments for its core symptoms. This has led some families and researchers to trial alternative remedies - including the non-intoxicating Cannabis sativa-derived compound cannabidivarin (CBDV). However, how CBDV affects the human brain is unknown. Previous (pre)clinical evidence suggests that CBDV may modulate brain excitatory-inhibitory systems, which are implicated in ASD. Hence, our main aim was to test, for the first time, if CBDV shifts glutamate and/or GABA metabolites - markers of the brain's primary excitatory and inhibitory system - in both the 'typical' and autistic brain. Our subsidiary aim was to determine whether, within ASD, brain responsivity to CBDV challenge is related to baseline biological phenotype. We tested this using a repeated-measures, double-blind, randomized-order, cross-over design. We used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to compare glutamate (Glx = glutamate + glutamine) and GABA + (GABA + macromolecules) levels following placebo (baseline) and 600 mg CBDV in 34 healthy men with (n = 17) and without (n = 17) ASD. Data acquisition from regions previously reliably linked to ASD (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, DMPFC; left basal ganglia, BG) commenced 2 h (peak plasma levels) after placebo/CBDV administration. Where CBDV significantly shifted metabolite levels, we examined the relationship of this change with baseline metabolite levels. Test sessions were at least 13 days apart to ensure CBDV wash-out. CBDV significantly increased Glx in the BG of both groups. However, this impact was not uniform across individuals. In the ASD group, and not in the typically developing controls, the 'shift' in Glx correlated negatively with baseline Glx concentration. In contrast, CBDV had no significant impact on Glx in the DMPFC, or on GABA+ in either voxel in either group. Our findings suggest that, as measured by MRS, CBDV modulates the glutamate-GABA system in the BG but not in frontal regions. Moreover, there is individual variation in response depending on baseline biochemistry. Future studies should examine the effect of CBDV on behaviour and if the response to an acute dose of CBDV could predict a potential clinical treatment response in ASD.},

	Abstract = {Mutations affecting mTOR or RAS signaling underlie defined syndromes (the so-called mTORopathies and RASopathies) with high risk for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). These syndromes show a broad variety of somatic phenotypes including cancers, skin abnormalities, heart disease and facial dysmorphisms. Less well studied are the neuropsychiatric symptoms such as ASD. Here, we assess the relevance of these signalopathies in ASD reviewing genetic, human cell model, rodent studies and clinical trials. We conclude that signalopathies have an increased liability for ASD and that, in particular, ASD individuals with dysmorphic features and intellectual disability (ID) have a higher chance for disruptive mutations in RAS- and mTOR-related genes. Studies on rodent and human cell models confirm aberrant neuronal development as the underlying pathology. Human studies further suggest that multiple hits are necessary to induce the respective phenotypes. Recent clinical trials do only report improvements for comorbid conditions such as epilepsy or cancer but not for behavioral aspects. Animal models show that treatment during early development can rescue behavioral phenotypes. Taken together, we suggest investigating the differential roles of mTOR and RAS signaling in both human and rodent models, and to test drug treatment both during and after neuronal development in the available model systems.},

Camouflaging more strongly predicted generalised and social anxiety than depression. No interaction between camouflaging and gender was found.<h4>Limitations</h4>These results cannot be generalised to autistic people with intellectual disability, or autistic children and young people. The sample did not include sufficient numbers of non-binary people to run separate analyses; therefore, it is possible that camouflaging impacts mental health differently in this population.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The findings suggest that camouflaging is a risk factor for mental health problems in autistic adults without intellectual disability, regardless of gender. We also identified levels of camouflaging at which risk of mental health problems is highest, suggesting clinicians should be particularly aware of mental health problems in those who score at or above these levels.},

	Abstract = {When observing other people during naturally paced and dynamic interactions, it is essential to look at specific locations at the right time to extract a maximum of socially informative content. In this study, we aimed to investigate the looking behavior of typically developing toddlers and toddlers later diagnosed with autism when observing other children interact. The sample consisted of 98 toddlers; 22 in a low-likelihood of autism group, 60 in an elevated likelihood of autism group who did not receive a subsequent diagnosis, and 16 in an elevated likelihood group who did receive an autism diagnosis. Participants performed an eye tracking task at 18 months of age and were assessed for diagnostic outcome at 36 months. The video stimuli consisted of two children interacting, where a boy reaches out for a toy and a girl refuses to give it to him. The low likelihood group showed an expected increase in ratio of looking at the girl's face after the boy requested the toy, as compared to before (t(21) = -3.337, p = .003). Toddlers with later autism showed a significantly lower ratio of looking at the girl's face during this time window, as compared to the other groups (F(2,91) = 3.698, p = .029). These findings provide new leads on how social gaze may be different in children with autism in everyday life (e.g., kindergarten), and highlight the need of studying the dynamics of gaze on short time scales.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>A considerable amount of research has discussed whether autism and psychiatric/neurodevelopmental conditions in general are best described categorically or dimensionally. In recent years, finite mixture models have been increasingly applied to mixed populations of autistic and non-autistic individuals to answer this question. However, the use of such methods with mixed populations may not be appropriate for two reasons: First, subgroups within mixed populations are often skewed and thus violate mixture models assumptions, which are based on weighted sum of Gaussian distributions. Second, these analyses have, to our knowledge, been solely applied to enriched samples, where the prevalence of the clinical condition within the study sample far exceeds epidemiological estimates.<h4>Method</h4>We employed a dual Weibull mixture model to examine the distribution of the Autism Spectrum Quotient scores of a mixed sample of autistic and non-autistic adults (<i>N</i> = 4717; autism = 811), as well as of a derived sample (from the enriched sample; <i>N</i> = 3973; autism = 67) that reflects the current prevalence of autism within the general population.<h4>Results</h4>In a mixed autistic and non-autistic population, our model provided a better description of the underlying structure of autistic traits than traditional finite Gaussian mixture models and performed well when applied to a sample that reflected the prevalence of autism in the general population. The model yielded results, which are consistent with predictions of current theories advocating for the co-existence of a mixed categorical and dimensional architecture within the autism spectrum.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The results provide insight into the continuum nature of the distribution of autistic traits, support the complementary role of both categorical and dimensional approaches to autism spectrum condition, and underscore the importance of analyzing samples that reflect the epidemiological prevalence of the condition. Owing to its flexibility to represent a wide variety of distributions, the Weibull distribution might be better suited for latent structure studies, within enriched and prevalence-true samples.},

	Abstract = {Dimensional approaches to psychopathology interrogate the core neurocognitive domains interacting at the individual level to shape diagnostic symptoms. Embedding this approach in prospective longitudinal studies could transform our understanding of the mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental disorders. Such designs require us to move beyond traditional group comparisons and determine which domain-specific alterations apply at the level of the individual, and whether they vary across distinct phenotypic subgroups. As a proof of principle, this study examines how the domain of face processing contributes to the emergence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We used an event-related potentials (ERPs) task in a cohort of 8-month-old infants with (n = 148) and without (n = 68) an older sibling with ASD, and combined traditional case-control comparisons with machine-learning techniques for prediction of social traits and ASD diagnosis at 36 months, and Bayesian hierarchical clustering for stratification into subgroups. A broad profile of alterations in the time-course of neural processing of faces in infancy was predictive of later ASD, with a strong convergence in ERP features predicting social traits and diagnosis. We identified two main subgroups in ASD, defined by distinct patterns of neural responses to faces, which differed on later sensory sensitivity. Taken together, our findings suggest that individual differences between infants contribute to the diffuse pattern of alterations predictive of ASD in the first year of life. Moving from group-level comparisons to pattern recognition and stratification can help to understand and reduce heterogeneity in clinical cohorts, and improve our understanding of the mechanisms that lead to later neurodevelopmental outcomes.

Early studies focused on the identification of genetic variants associated with autism, but more recently, research has expanded to investigate neurodevelopmental markers. While ethicists have extensively discussed issues around advances in autism genomics, much less ethical scrutiny has focused on research on early neurodevelopment and on the interventions being developed as a result.<h4>Objectives</h4>We summarize the current state of the science on the identification of early markers for autism and its potential clinical applications, before providing an overview of the ethical issues arising from increasing understanding of children's neurodevelopment in very early life.<h4>Results</h4>Advances in the understanding of brain and behavioral trajectories preceding later autism diagnosis raise ethical concerns around three themes: (a) New models for understanding autism; (b) Risks and benefits of early identification and intervention; and (c) Communication of early concerns to families. These ethical issues should be further investigated in research conducted in partnership with autistic people and their families.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This paper highlights the need for ethical scrutiny of early neurodevelopmental research in autism. Scrutiny requires expertise and methods from the basic sciences and bioethics, as well as constructive collaborations among autistic people, their parents, and autism researchers to anticipate early interventions that serve the community's interests and accommodate the varied experiences and preferences of people on the spectrum and their families.},

	Abstract = {Genetic overlap involving rare disrupting mutations may contribute to high comorbidity rates between autism spectrum disorders and epilepsy. Despite their polygenic nature, genome-wide association studies have not reported a significant contribution of common genetic variation to comorbidity between both conditions. Analysis of common genetic variation affecting specific shared pathways such as miRNA dysregulation could help to elucidate the polygenic mechanisms underlying comorbidity between autism spectrum disorders and epilepsy. We evaluated here the role of common predisposing variation to autism spectrum disorders and epilepsy across target genes of 14 miRNAs selected through bibliographic research as being dysregulated in both disorders. We considered 4,581 target genes from various <i>in silico</i> sources. We described negative genetic correlation between autism spectrum disorders and epilepsy across variants located within target genes of the 14 miRNAs selected (<i>p</i> = 0.0228). Moreover, polygenic transmission disequilibrium test on an independent cohort of autism spectrum disorders trios (N = 233) revealed an under-transmission of autism spectrum disorders predisposing alleles within miRNAs' target genes across autism spectrum disorders trios without comorbid epilepsy, thus reinforcing the negative relationship at the common genetic variation between both traits. Our study provides evidence of a negative relationship between autism spectrum disorders and epilepsy at the common genetic variation level that becomes more evident when focusing on the miRNA regulatory networks, which contrasts with observed clinical comorbidity and results from rare variation studies. Our findings may help to conceptualize the genetic heterogeneity and the comorbidity with epilepsy in autism spectrum disorders.},

	Abstract = {Multiple molecular pathways and cellular processes have been implicated in the neurobiology of autism and other neurodevelopmental conditions. There is a current focus on synaptic gene conditions, or synaptopathies, which refer to clinical conditions associated with rare genetic variants disrupting genes involved in synaptic biology. Synaptopathies are commonly associated with autism and developmental delay and may be associated with a range of other neuropsychiatric outcomes. Altered synaptic biology is suggested by both preclinical and clinical studies in autism based on evidence of differences in early brain structural development and altered glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission potentially perturbing excitatory and inhibitory balance. This review focusses on the NRXN-NLGN-SHANK pathway, which is implicated in the synaptic assembly, trans-synaptic signalling, and synaptic functioning. We provide an overview of the insights from preclinical molecular studies of the pathway. Concentrating on NRXN1 deletion and SHANK3 mutations, we discuss emerging understanding of cellular processes and electrophysiology from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) models derived from individuals with synaptopathies, neuroimaging and behavioural findings in animal models of Nrxn1 and Shank3 synaptic gene conditions, and key findings regarding autism features, brain and behavioural phenotypes from human clinical studies of synaptopathies. The identification of molecular-based biomarkers from preclinical models aims to advance the development of targeted therapeutic treatments. However, it remains challenging to translate preclinical animal models and iPSC studies to interpret human brain development and autism features. We discuss the existing challenges in preclinical and clinical synaptopathy research, and potential solutions to align methodologies across preclinical and clinical research. Bridging the translational gap between preclinical and clinical studies will be necessary to understand biological mechanisms, to identify targeted therapies, and ultimately to progress towards personalised approaches for complex neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism.},

To address this, the authors developed the largest study of lifestyle patterns of autistic adults and assessed their relationships to body mass index, health outcomes, and family history.<h4>Methods</h4>We administered an anonymized, online survey to n = 2386 adults (n = 1183 autistic) aged 16-90 years of age. We employed Fisher's exact tests and binomial logistic regression to describe diet, exercise, and sleep patterns; mediation of seizure disorders on sleep; body mass index (BMI); relationships of lifestyle factors to BMI, cardiovascular conditions, and diabetic conditions; and sex differences among autistic adults.<h4>Results</h4>Autistic adults, and particularly autistic females, exhibit unhealthy diet, exercise, and sleep patterns; they are also more likely to be underweight or obese. Limited sleep duration and high rates of sleep disturbances cannot be accounted for by epilepsy or seizure disorders. Lifestyle factors are positively related to higher risk of cardiovascular conditions among autistic males, even more than family history.<h4>Limitations</h4>Our sample may not be representative of all autistic and non-autistic people, as it primarily comprised individuals who are white, female, have a high school education or higher, and reside in the UK. Our sampling methods may also exclude some individuals on the autism spectrum, and particularly those with moderate to severe intellectual disability. This is a cross-sectional sample that can test for relationships between factors (e.g., lifestyle factors and health outcomes) but cannot assess the direction of these relationships.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Autistic adults are less likely to meet minimal health recommendations for diet, exercise, and sleep-and these unhealthy behaviors may relate to excess risk of cardiovascular conditions. Although the present study can only provide preliminary, correlational evidence, our findings suggest that diet, exercise, and sleep should be considered and further investigated as key targets for reducing the now widely reported and dramatically increased risks of health comorbidity and premature death among autistic individuals compared to others. Physicians should work cooperatively with patients to provide health education and develop individualized strategies for how to better manage challenges with diet, exercise, and sleep.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Face individual identity recognition skill is heritable and independent of intellectual ability. Difficulties in face individual identity recognition are present in autistic individuals and their family members and are possibly linked to oxytocin polymorphisms in families with an autistic child. While it is reported that developmental prosopagnosia (i.e., impaired face identity recognition) occurs in 2-3% of the general population, no prosopagnosia prevalence estimate is available for autism. Furthermore, an autism within-group approach has not been reported towards characterizing impaired face memory and to investigate its possible links to social and communication difficulties.<h4>Methods</h4>The present study estimated the prevalence of prosopagnosia in 80 autistic adults with no intellectual disability, investigated its cognitive characteristics and links to autism symptoms' severity, personality traits, and mental state understanding from the eye region by using standardized tests and questionnaires.<h4>Results</h4>More than one third of autistic participants showed prosopagnosia. Their face memory skill was not associated with their symptom's severity, empathy, alexithymia, or general intelligence. Face identity recognition was instead linked to mental state recognition from the eye region only in autistic individuals who had prosopagnosia, and this relationship did not depend on participants' basic face perception skills. Importantly, we found that autistic participants were not aware of their face memory skills.<h4>Limitations</h4>We did not test an epidemiological sample, and additional work is necessary to establish whether these results generalize to the entire autism spectrum.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Impaired face individual identity recognition meets the criteria to be a potential endophenotype in autism. In the future, testing for face memory could be used to stratify autistic individuals into genetically meaningful subgroups and be translatable to autism animal models.},

	Abstract = {Predictive Processing accounts of autism claim that autistic individuals assign higher precision to their prediction errors than non-autistic individuals, that is, autistic individuals update their predictions more readily when faced with unexpected sensory input. Since setting the level of precision is a fundamental part of perception and learning, we propose that such differences should be detectable in various domains at a very early age, before clinical symptoms have fully emerged. We therefore tested 3-year-old younger siblings of autistic children, with a high likelihood of later receiving an autism diagnosis themselves, and low-likelihood children with an older sibling without autism. We used a novel implicit learning paradigm to examine the effect of sensory noise on the predictions participants built. In order to learn a sequence, our participants had to select which visual information to attend to and disregard low-level prediction errors caused by the sensory noise, which the theory claims is more difficult for autistic individuals. Contrary to the proposed higher precision-weighting of prediction errors in autism, the high-likelihood children did not show signs of updating their predictions more readily when we added sensory noise compared to the low-likelihood children, either in their reaction times or in the recurrence and determinism of their response locations. These results raise challenges for Predictive Processing theories of autism, specifically for the notion that prediction errors are inflexibly highly weighted by individuals with autism.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Introduction</h4>Response to treatment, according to Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scale, is an easily interpretable outcome in clinical trials of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Yet, the CGI-I rating is sometimes reported as a continuous outcome, and converting it to dichotomous would allow meta-analysis to incorporate more evidence.<h4>Methods</h4>Clinical trials investigating medications for ASD and presenting both dichotomous and continuous CGI-I data were included. The number of patients with at least much improvement (CGI-I ≤ 2) were imputed from the CGI-I scale, assuming an underlying normal distribution of a latent continuous score using a primary threshold θ = 2.5 instead of θ = 2, which is the original cut-off in the CGI-I scale. The original and imputed values were used to calculate responder rates and odds ratios. The performance of the imputation method was investigated with a concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), linear regression, Bland-Altman plots, and subgroup differences of summary estimates obtained from random-effects meta-analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Data from 27 studies, 58 arms, and 1428 participants were used. The imputation method using the primary threshold (θ = 2.5) had good performance for the responder rates (CCC = 0.93 95% confidence intervals [0.86, 0.96]; β of linear regression = 1.04 [0.95, 1.13]; bias and limits of agreements = 4.32% [-8.1%, 16.74%]; no subgroup differences χ<sup>2</sup> = 1.24, <i>p</i>-value = 0.266) and odds ratios (CCC = 0.91 [0.86, 0.96]; β = 0.96 [0.78, 1.14]; bias = 0.09 [-0.87, 1.04]; χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.02, <i>p</i>-value = 0.894). The imputation method had poorer performance when the secondary threshold (θ = 2) was used.<h4>Discussion</h4>Assuming a normal distribution of the CGI-I scale, the number of responders could be imputed from the mean and standard deviation and used in meta-analysis. Due to the wide limits of agreement of the imputation method, sensitivity analysis excluding studies with imputed values should be performed.},

This network meta-analysis investigated pharmacological and dietary-supplement treatments for ASD.<h4>Methods</h4>We searched for randomized-controlled-trials (RCTs) with a minimum duration of seven days in ClinicalTrials.gov, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, WHO-ICTRP (from inception up to July 8, 2018), CENTRAL and PubMed (up to November 3, 2021). The co-primary outcomes were core symptoms (social-communication difficulties-SCD, repetitive behaviors-RB, overall core symptoms-OCS) measured by validated scales and standardized-mean-differences (SMDs). Associated symptoms, e.g., irritability/aggression and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, dropouts and important side-effects, were investigated as secondary outcomes. Studies in children/adolescents and adults were analyzed separately in random-effects pairwise and network meta-analyses.<h4>Results</h4>We analyzed data for 41 drugs and 17 dietary-supplements, from 125 RCTs (n = 7450 participants) in children/adolescents and 18 RCTs (n = 1104) in adults. The following medications could improve at least one core symptom domain in comparison with placebo: aripiprazole (k = 6 studies in analysis, SCD: SMD = 0.27 95% CI [0.09, 0.44], RB: 0.48 [0.26, 0.70]), atomoxetine (k = 3, RB:0.49 [0.18, 0.80]), bumetanide (k = 4, RB: 0.35 [0.09, 0.62], OCS: 0.61 [0.31, 0.91]), and risperidone (k = 4, SCM: 0.31 [0.06, 0.55], RB: 0.60 [0.29, 0.90]; k = 3, OCS: 1.18 [0.75, 1.61]) in children/adolescents; fluoxetine (k = 1, RB: 1.20 [0.45, 1.96]), fluvoxamine (k = 1, RB: 1.04 [0.27, 1.81]), oxytocin (k = 6, RB:0.41 [0.16, 0.66]) and risperidone (k = 1, RB: 0.97 [0.21,1.74]) in adults. There were some indications of improvement by carnosine, haloperidol, folinic acid, guanfacine, omega-3-fatty-acids, probiotics, sulforaphane, tideglusib and valproate, yet imprecise and not robust. Confidence in these estimates was very low or low, except moderate for oxytocin. Medications differed substantially in improving associated symptoms, and in their side-effect profiles.<h4>Limitations</h4>Most of the studies were inadequately powered (sample sizes of 20-80 participants), with short duration (8-13 weeks), and about a third focused on associated symptoms. Networks were mainly star-shaped, and there were indications of reporting bias. There was no optimal rating scale measuring change in core symptoms.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Some medications could improve core symptoms, although this could be likely secondary to the improvement of associated symptoms. Evidence on their efficacy and safety is preliminary; therefore, routine prescription of medications for the core symptoms cannot be recommended. Trial registration PROSPERO-ID CRD42019125317.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Heterogeneity in the phenotypic presentation of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is apparent in the profile and the severity of sensory features. Here, we applied factor mixture modelling (FMM) to test a multidimensional factor model of sensory processing in ASD. We aimed to identify homogeneous sensory subgroups in ASD that differ intrinsically in their severity along continuous factor scores. We also investigated sensory subgroups in relation to clinical variables: sex, age, IQ, social-communication symptoms, restricted and repetitive behaviours, adaptive functioning and symptoms of anxiety and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.<h4>Methods</h4>Three hundred thirty-two children and adults with ASD between the ages of 6 and 30 years with IQs varying between 40 and 148 were included. First, three different confirmatory factor models were fit to the 38 items of the Short Sensory Profile (SSP). Then, latent class models (with two-to-six subgroups) were evaluated. The best performing factor model, the 7-factor structure, was subsequently used in two FMMs that varied in the number of subgroups: a two-subgroup, seven-factor model and a three-subgroup and seven-factor model.<h4>Results</h4>The 'three-subgroup/seven-factor' FMM was superior to all other models based on different fit criteria. Identified subgroups differed in sensory severity from severe, moderate to low. Accounting for the potential confounding effects of age and IQ, participants in these sensory subgroups had different levels of social-communicative symptoms, restricted and repetitive behaviours, adaptive functioning skills and symptoms of inattention and anxiety.<h4>Limitations</h4>Results were derived using a single parent-report measure of sensory features, the SSP, which limits the generalisability of findings.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Sensory features can be best described by three homogeneous sensory subgroups that differ in sensory severity gradients along seven continuous factor scores. Identified sensory subgroups were further differentiated by the severity of core and co-occurring symptoms, and level of adaptive functioning, providing novel evidence on the associated clinical correlates of sensory subgroups. These sensory subgroups provide a platform to further interrogate the neurobiological and genetic correlates of altered sensory processing in ASD.},

To investigate this, we use five independently recruited cross-sectional datasets consisting of 641,860 individuals who completed information on gender, neurodevelopmental and psychiatric diagnoses including autism, and measures of traits related to autism (self-report measures of autistic traits, empathy, systemizing, and sensory sensitivity). Compared to cisgender individuals, transgender and gender-diverse individuals have, on average, higher rates of autism, other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric diagnoses. For both autistic and non-autistic individuals, transgender and gender-diverse individuals score, on average, higher on self-report measures of autistic traits, systemizing, and sensory sensitivity, and, on average, lower on self-report measures of empathy. The results may have clinical implications for improving access to mental health care and tailoring adequate support for transgender and gender-diverse individuals.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4> Autism spectrum disorder (autism) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition with pronounced behavioural, cognitive, and neural heterogeneities across individuals. Here, our goal was to characterise heterogeneity in autism by identifying patterns of neural diversity as reflected in BOLD fMRI in the way individuals with autism engage with a varied array of cognitive tasks. <h4>Methods</h4> All analyses were based on the EU-AIMS/AIMS-2-TRIALS multisite Longitudinal European Autism Project (LEAP) with participants with autism and typically developing controls (TD) between 6 and 30 years of age. We employed a novel task-potency approach which combines the unique aspects of both resting-state fMRI and task-fMRI to quantify task-induced variations in the functional connectome. Normative modelling was used to map atypicality of features on an individual basis with respect to their distribution in neurotypical control participants. We applied robust out-of-sample canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to relate connectome data to behavioural data. <h4>Results</h4> Deviation from the normative ranges of global functional connectivity was greater for individuals with autism compared to TD in each fMRI task paradigm (all tasks p<0.001). The similarity across individuals of the deviation pattern was significantly increased in autistic relative to TD individuals (p<0.002). The CCA identified significant and robust brainbehavior covariation between functional connectivity atypicality and autism-related behavioral features. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Individuals with autism engage with tasks in a globally atypical way, but the particular spatial pattern of this atypicality is nevertheless similar across tasks. Atypicalities in the tasks originate mostly from prefrontal cortex and default mode network regions, but also speech and auditory networks. We show, moving forward, sophisticated modeling methods such as task-potency and normative modeling will prove key to unravelling complex heterogeneous conditions like autism.},

It remains unknown, however, whether these symptoms are mediated by the same or distinct neural mechanisms as in idiopathic ASD. Here, we examined differences in lGI associated with ASD in 50 individuals with 22q11.2DS (n = 25 with ASD, n = 25 without ASD) and 81 individuals without 22q11.2DS (n = 40 with ASD, n = 41 typically developing controls). We initially utilized a factorial design to identify the set of brain regions where lGI is associated with the main effect of 22q11.2DS, ASD, and with the 22q11.2DS-by-ASD interaction term. Subsequently, we employed canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to compare the multivariate association between variability in lGI and the complex clinical phenotype of ASD between 22q11.2DS carriers and noncarriers. Across approaches, we established that even though there is a high degree of clinical similarity across groups, the associated patterns of lGI significantly differed between carriers and noncarriers of the 22q11.2 microdeletion. Our results suggest that ASD symptomatology recruits different neuroanatomical underpinnings across disorders and that 22q11.2DS individuals with ASD represent a neuroanatomically distinct subgroup that differs from 22q11.2DS individuals without ASD and from individuals with idiopathic ASD.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Understanding the development of the neuronal circuitry underlying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is critical to shed light into its etiology and for the development of treatment options. Resting state EEG provides a window into spontaneous local and long-range neuronal synchronization and has been investigated in many ASD studies, but results are inconsistent. Unbiased investigation in large and comprehensive samples focusing on replicability is needed.<h4>Methods</h4>We quantified resting state EEG alpha peak metrics, power spectrum (PS, 2-32 Hz) and functional connectivity (FC) in 411 children, adolescents and adults (n = 212 ASD, n = 199 neurotypicals [NT], all with IQ > 75). We performed analyses in source-space using individual head models derived from the participants' MRIs. We tested for differences in mean and variance between the ASD and NT groups for both PS and FC using linear mixed effects models accounting for age, sex, IQ and site effects. Then, we used machine learning to assess whether a multivariate combination of EEG features could better separate ASD and NT participants. All analyses were embedded within a train-validation approach (70%-30% split).<h4>Results</h4>In the training dataset, we found an interaction between age and group for the reactivity to eye opening (p = .042 uncorrected), and a significant but weak multivariate ASD vs. NT classification performance for PS and FC (sensitivity 0.52-0.62, specificity 0.59-0.73). None of these findings replicated significantly in the validation dataset, although the effect size in the validation dataset overlapped with the prediction interval from the training dataset.<h4>Limitations</h4>The statistical power to detect weak effects-of the magnitude of those found in the training dataset-in the validation dataset is small, and we cannot fully conclude on the reproducibility of the training dataset's effects.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This suggests that PS and FC values in ASD and NT have a strong overlap, and that differences between both groups (in both mean and variance) have, at best, a small effect size. Larger studies would be needed to investigate and replicate such potential effects.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition with key deficits in social functioning. It is widely assumed that the biological underpinnings of social impairment are neurofunctional alterations in the "social brain," a neural circuitry involved in inferring the mental state of a social partner. However, previous evidence comes from small-scale studies and findings have been mixed. We therefore carried out the to-date largest study on neural correlates of mentalizing in ASD.<h4>Methods</h4>As part of the Longitudinal European Autism Project, we performed functional magnetic resonance imaging at six European sites in a large, well-powered, and deeply phenotyped sample of individuals with ASD (N = 205) and typically developing (TD) individuals (N = 189) aged 6 to 30 years. We presented an animated shapes task to assess and comprehensively characterize social brain activation during mentalizing. We tested for effects of age, diagnosis, and their association with symptom measures, including a continuous measure of autistic traits.<h4>Results</h4>We observed robust effects of task. Within the ASD sample, autistic traits were moderately associated with functional activation in one of the key regions of the social brain, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. However, there were no significant effects of diagnosis on task performance and no effects of age and diagnosis on social brain responses. Besides a lack of mean group differences, our data provide no evidence for meaningful differences in the distribution of brain response measures. Extensive control analyses suggest that the lack of case-control differences was not due to a variety of potential confounders.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Contrary to prior reports, this large-scale study does not support the assumption that altered social brain activation during mentalizing forms a common neural marker of ASD, at least with the paradigm we employed. Yet, autistic individuals show socio-behavioral deficits. Our work therefore highlights the need to interrogate social brain function with other brain measures, such as connectivity and network-based approaches, using other paradigms, or applying complementary analysis approaches to assess individual differences in this heterogeneous condition.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Visual exploration in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by attenuated social attention. The underlying oculomotor function during visual exploration is understudied, whereas oculomotor function during restricted viewing suggested saccade dysmetria in ASD by altered pontocerebellar motor modulation.<h4>Methods</h4>Oculomotor function was recorded using remote eye tracking in 142 ASD participants and 142 matched neurotypical controls during free viewing of naturalistic videos with and without human content. The sample was heterogenous concerning age (6-30 years), cognitive ability (60-140 IQ), and male/female ratio (3:1). Oculomotor function was defined as saccade, fixation, and pupil-dilation features that were compared between groups in linear mixed models. Oculomotor function was investigated as ASD classifier and features were correlated with clinical measures.<h4>Results</h4>We observed decreased saccade duration (∆M = -0.50, CI [-0.21, -0.78]) and amplitude (∆M = -0.42, CI [-0.12, -0.72]), which was independent of human video content. We observed null findings concerning fixation and pupil-dilation features (POWER = .81). Oculomotor function is a valid ASD classifier comparable to social attention concerning discriminative power. Within ASD, saccade features correlated with measures of restricted and repetitive behavior.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We conclude saccade dysmetria as ASD oculomotor phenotype relevant to visual exploration. Decreased saccade amplitude and duration indicate spatially clustered fixations that attenuate visual exploration and emphasize endogenous over exogenous attention. We propose altered pontocerebellar motor modulation as underlying mechanism that contributes to atypical (oculo-)motor coordination and attention function in ASD.},

	Abstract = {Pattern classification and stratification approaches have increasingly been used in research on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) over the last ten years with the goal of translation towards clinical applicability. Here, we present an extensive scoping literature review on those two approaches. We screened a total of 635 studies, of which 57 pattern classification and 19 stratification studies were included. We observed large variance across pattern classification studies in terms of predictive performance from about 60% to 98% accuracy, which is among other factors likely linked to sampling bias, different validation procedures across studies, the heterogeneity of ASD and differences in data quality. Stratification studies were less prevalent with only two studies reporting replications and just a few showing external validation. While some identified strata based on cognition and intelligence reappear across studies, biology as a stratification marker is clearly underexplored. In summary, mapping biological differences at the level of the individual with ASD is a major challenge for the field now. Conceptualizing those mappings and individual trajectories that lead to the diagnosis of ASD, will become a major challenge in the near future.},

	Abstract = {Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) quality is known to impact and bias neuroanatomical estimates and downstream analysis, including case-control comparisons. However, despite this, limited work has systematically evaluated the impact of image and image-processing quality on these measures, or compared different quality control (QC) methods and metrics. The growing size of typical neuroimaging datasets presents an additional challenge to QC, which is typically extremely time and labour intensive. Two of the most important aspects of MRI quality are motion, which is known to have a substantial impact on cortical measures in particular, and the accuracy of processed outputs, which have been shown to impact neurodevelopmental trajectories. Here, we present a tool, FSQC, that enables quick and efficient yet thorough assessment of both of these aspects in outputs of the FreeSurfer processing pipeline. We validate our method against other existing QC metrics, including the automated FreeSurfer Euler number, and two other manual ratings of raw image quality. We show strikingly similar spatial patterns in the relationship between each QC measure and cortical thickness; relationships for cortical volume and surface area are largely consistent across metrics, though with some notable differences. We next demonstrate that thresholding by QC score attenuates but does eliminate the impact of quality on cortical estimates. Finally, we explore different ways of controlling for quality when examining differences between autistic individuals and neurotypical controls in the ABIDE dataset, demonstrating that inadequate control for quality can alter results of case-control comparisons.},

	Abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental condition, and infant siblings of children with ASD are at a higher risk of developing autistic traits or an ASD diagnosis, when compared to those with typically developing siblings. Reports of differences in brain anatomy and function in high-risk infants which predict later autistic behaviors are emerging, but although cerebellar and subcortical brain regions have been frequently implicated in ASD, no high-risk study has examined these regions. Therefore, in this study, we compared regional MRI volumes across the whole brain in 4-6-month-old infants with (high-risk, n = 24) and without (low-risk, n = 26) a sibling with ASD. Within the high-risk group, we also examined whether any regional differences observed were associated with autistic behaviors at 36 months. We found that high-risk infants had significantly larger cerebellar and subcortical volumes at 4-6-months of age, relative to low-risk infants; and that larger volumes in high-risk infants were linked to more repetitive behaviors at 36 months. Our preliminary observations require replication in longitudinal studies of larger samples. If correct, they suggest that the early subcortex and cerebellum volumes may be predictive biomarkers for childhood repetitive behaviors. Autism Res 2019, 12: 614-627. © 2019 The Authors.

LAY SUMMARY: Individuals with a family history of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are at risk of ASD and related developmental difficulties. This study revealed that 4-6-month-old infants at high-risk of ASD have larger cerebellum and subcortical volumes than low-risk infants, and that larger volumes in high-risk infants are associated with more repetitive behaviors in childhood.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>The concomitant role of the Central Executive, the Saliency and the Social Cognition networks in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in demanding ecological tasks remains unanswered. We addressed this question using a novel task-based fMRI virtual-reality task mimicking a challenging daily-life chore that may present some difficulties to individuals with ASD: the EcoSupermarketX.<h4>Methods</h4>Participants included 29 adolescents: 15 with ASD and 15 with typical neurodevelopment (TD). They performed the EcoSupermarketX (a shopping simulation with three goal-oriented sub-tasks including "no cue", "non-social" or "social" cues), during neuroimaging and eye-tracking.<h4>Results</h4>ASD differed from TD only in total time and distance to complete the "social cue" sub-task with matched eye-tracking measures. Neuroimaging revealed simultaneous hyperactivation across social, executive, and saliency circuits in ASD. In contrast, ASD showed reduced activation in the parahippocampal gyrus, involved in scene recognition.<h4>Conclusions</h4>When performing a virtual shopping task matching the performance of controls, ASD adolescents hyperactivate three core networks: executive, saliency and social cognition. Parahippocampal hypoactivation is consistent with effortless eidetic scene processing, in line with the notion of peaks and valleys of neural recruitment in individuals with ASD. These hyperactivation/hypoactivation patterns in daily life tasks provide a circuit-level signature of neural diversity in ASD, a possible intervention target.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Prenatal sex steroids have been associated with autism in several clinical and epidemiological studies. It is unclear how this relates to the autistic traits of the mother and how early this can be detected during pregnancy and postnatal development.<h4>Methods</h4>Maternal serum was collected from pregnant women (n = 122) before or during their first ultrasound appointment [mean = 12.7 (SD = 0.7) weeks]. Concentrations of the following were measured via immunoassays: testosterone, estradiol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, progesterone; and sex hormone-binding globulin which was used to compute the free fractions of estradiol (FEI) and testosterone (FTI). Standardised human choriogonadotropin (hCG) and pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) values were obtained from clinical records corresponding to the same serum samples. Mothers completed the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) and for their infants, the Quantitative Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (Q-CHAT) when the infants were between 18 and 20 months old.<h4>Results</h4>FEI was positively associated with maternal autistic traits in univariate (n = 108, Pearson's r = 0.22, p = 0.019) and multiple regression models (semipartial r = 0.19, p = 0.048) controlling for maternal age and a diagnosis of PCOS. Maternal estradiol levels significantly interacted with fetal sex in predicting infant Q-CHAT scores, with a positive relationship in males but not females (n = 100, interaction term: semipartial r = 0.23, p = 0.036) after controlling for maternal AQ and other covariates. The opposite was found for standardised hCG values and Q-CHAT scores, with a positive association in females but not in males (n = 151, interaction term: r = -0.25, p = 0.005).<h4>Limitations</h4>Sample size of this cohort was small, with potential ascertainment bias given elective recruitment. Clinical covariates were controlled in multiple regression models, but additional research is needed to confirm the statistically significant findings in larger cohorts.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Maternal steroid factors during pregnancy are associated with autistic traits in mothers and their infants.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Alexithymia (difficulties in identifying and describing emotion) is a transdiagnostic trait implicated in social-emotional and mental health problems in the general population. Many autistic individuals experience significant social-communication difficulties and elevated anxiety/depression and alexithymia. Nevertheless, the role of alexithymia in explaining individual variability in the quality/severity of social-communication difficulties and/or anxiety and depression symptoms in autism remains poorly understood.<h4>Methods</h4>In total, 337 adolescents and adults (autism <i>N</i> = 179) were assessed for alexithymia on the Toronto Alexithymia Scale and for social-communication difficulties, anxiety and depression symptoms. A total of 135 individuals (autism <i>N</i> = 76) were followed up 12-24 months later. We used regression models to establish cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between alexithymia, social-communication difficulties, anxiety and depression symptoms.<h4>Results</h4>Autistic individuals reported significantly higher alexithymia than comparison individuals (<i>p</i> < 0.001, <i>r</i> effect size = 0.48), with 47.3% of autistic females and 21.0% of autistic males meeting cut-off for clinically relevant alexithymia (score ⩾61). Difficulties in <i>describing</i> feelings were particularly associated with current self-reported social-communication difficulties [<i>p</i> < 0.001, <i>β</i> = 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44-0.67] and predicted later social-communication difficulties (<i>p</i> = 0.02, <i>β</i> = 0.43, 95% CI 0.07-0.82). Difficulties in <i>identifying</i> feelings were particularly associated with current anxiety symptom severity (<i>p</i> < 0.001, <i>β</i> = 0.54, 95% CI 0.41-0.77) and predicted later anxiety (<i>p</i> = 0.01; <i>β</i> = 0.31, 95% CI 0.08-0.62).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings suggest that difficulties in identifying <i>v</i>. describing emotion are associated with differential clinical outcomes in autism. Psychological therapies targeting emotional awareness may improve social-communication and anxiety symptoms in autism, potentially conferring long-term benefits.},

	Abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition that is characterized by differences in social interaction, repetitive behaviors, restricted interests, and sensory differences beginning early in life. Especially sensory symptoms are highly correlated with the severity of other behavioral differences. ASD is a highly heterogeneous condition on multiple levels, including clinical presentation, genetics, and developmental trajectories. Over a thousand genes have been implicated in ASD. This has facilitated the generation of more than two hundred genetic mouse models that are contributing to understanding the biological underpinnings of ASD. Since the first symptoms already arise during early life, it is especially important to identify both spatial and temporal gene functions in relation to the ASD phenotype. To further decompose the heterogeneity, ASD-related genes can be divided into different subgroups based on common functions, such as genes involved in synaptic function. Furthermore, finding common biological processes that are modulated by this subgroup of genes is essential for possible patient stratification and the development of personalized early treatments. Here, we review the current knowledge on behavioral rodent models of synaptic dysfunction by focusing on behavioral phenotypes, spatial and temporal gene function, and molecular targets that could lead to new targeted gene-based therapy.},

	Abstract = {In the past two decades, several screening instruments were developed to detect toddlers who may be autistic both in clinical and unselected samples. Among others, the Quantitative CHecklist for Autism in Toddlers (Q-CHAT) is a quantitative and normally distributed measure of autistic traits that demonstrates good psychometric properties in different settings and cultures. Recently, machine learning (ML) has been applied to behavioral science to improve the classification performance of autism screening and diagnostic tools, but mainly in children, adolescents, and adults. In this study, we used ML to investigate the accuracy and reliability of the Q-CHAT in discriminating young autistic children from those without. Five different ML algorithms (random forest (RF), naïve Bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), and K-nearest neighbors (KNN)) were applied to investigate the complete set of Q-CHAT items. Our results showed that ML achieved an overall accuracy of 90%, and the SVM was the most effective, being able to classify autism with 95% accuracy. Furthermore, using the SVM-recursive feature elimination (RFE) approach, we selected a subset of 14 items ensuring 91% accuracy, while 83% accuracy was obtained from the 3 best discriminating items in common to ours and the previously reported Q-CHAT-10. This evidence confirms the high performance and cross-cultural validity of the Q-CHAT, and supports the application of ML to create shorter and faster versions of the instrument, maintaining high classification accuracy, to be used as a quick, easy, and high-performance tool in primary-care settings.},

	Abstract = {<p>Background: The global COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on European health and social care systems, with demands on testing, hospital and intensive care capacity exceeding available resources in many regions. This has led to concerns that some groups, including autistic people/ those with intellectual disability (ID), may become excluded from services. <h4>Methods:</h4> We reviewed policies from 15 European member states, published March-July 2020, pertaining to: 1) accessibility of COVID-19 testing; 2) provisions for treatment, hospitalisation and intensive care units (ICU); and 3) changes to standard health and social care. In parallel, we analysed survey data on the lived experiences of 1,301 autistic people and caregivers. <h4>Results:</h4> Autistic people/ those with ID experienced significant barriers accessing COVID-19 services. First, despite these groups being at elevated risk for severe illness due to co-morbid health conditions, there was a lack of access to COVID-19 testing. Second, many COVID-19 outpatient and inpatient treatment services were reported to be inaccessible - predominantly resulting from individual differences in communication needs. Third, ICU triage protocols (directly or indirectly) resulted in discriminatory exclusion from lifesaving treatments. Last, interruptions to standard health and social care left over 70% of autistic people without everyday support. <h4>Conclusions:</h4> The COVID-19 pandemic has further emphasised healthcare inequalities for autistic people/ those with ID, likely contributing to disproportionate increases in morbidity and mortality in these groups. Current policies and guidelines regarding the accessibility of COVID-19 services require urgent revision to prevent the widespread exclusion of autistic people and those with ID from services, which represents a violation of international human rights law.</p>},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Emotion dysregulation (ED) is common in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and often results in adverse outcomes. However, ED has been suggested as a transdiagnostic construct, why the specific association between ADHD and ED when adjusting for other mental health conditions needs further investigation. It is also important to determine the aetiological basis of the association between ADHD and ED to inform the theoretical conceptualization of ADHD.<h4>Method</h4>This study used a co-twin control design, including a sample of dizygotic (DZ) and monozygotic (MZ) twins (N = 389; 45.8% females, age = 8-31 years, MZ twin pairs 57.6%). ED was assessed using the dysregulation profile from the parent-rated Child Behaviour Checklist and its adult version. Regression analyses were used across individuals and within the pairs, while adjusting for diagnoses of autism, intellectual disability, other neurodevelopmental conditions and affective conditions.<h4>Results</h4>ADHD was significantly associated with ED, even when adjusting for age, sex, attention problems and other mental health conditions, and was the diagnosis most strongly associated with ED. Within-pair analyses revealed that twins with ADHD had higher levels of ED compared to their co-twin without ADHD. This association remained within DZ twins and was non-significant in the MZ subsample, with non-overlapping confidence intervals between the DZ and MZ estimates.<h4>Conclusion</h4>ADHD is strongly and in part independently linked to ED, stressing the importance of early detection and treatment of emotional difficulties within this group. The findings from the within-pair analyses indicate a genetic influence on the association between ADHD and ED.},

	Abstract = {Emotion processing-including signals from facial expressions-is often altered in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The biological basis of this is poorly understood but may include neurochemically mediated differences in the responsivity of key 'limbic' regions (including amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc)). Emerging evidence also suggests that ASD may be a disorder of brain temporal dynamics. Moreover, serotonin (5-HT) has been shown to be a key regulator of both facial-emotion processing and brain dynamics, and 5-HT abnormalities have been consistently implicated in ASD. To date, however, no one has examined how 5-HT influences the dynamics of facial-emotion processing in ASD. Therefore, we compared the influence of 5-HT on the responsivity of brain dynamics during facial-emotion processing in individuals with and without ASD. Participants completed a facial-emotion processing fMRI task at least 8 days apart using a randomised double-blind crossover design. At each visit they received either a single 20-mg oral dose of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram or placebo. We found that citalopram (which increases levels of 5-HT) caused sustained activation in key limbic regions during processing of negative facial emotions in adults with ASD-but not in neurotypical adults. The neurotypical adults' limbic response reverted more rapidly to baseline following a 5-HT-challenge. Our results suggest that serotonergic homoeostatic control of the temporal dynamics in limbic regions is altered in adults with ASD, and provide a fresh perspective on the biology of ASD.},

	Abstract = {Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are highly heritable and are characterized by deficits in social communication and restricted and repetitive behaviors. Twin studies on phenotypic subdomains suggest a differing underlying genetic etiology. Studying genetic variation explaining phenotypic variance will help to identify specific underlying pathomechanisms. We investigated the effect of common variation on ASD subdomains in two cohorts including >2500 individuals. Based on the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), we identified and confirmed six subdomains with a SNP-based genetic heritability h<sup>2</sup><sub>SNP</sub> = 0.2-0.4. The subdomains nonverbal communication (NVC), social interaction (SI), and peer interaction (PI) shared genetic risk factors, while the subdomains of repetitive sensory-motor behavior (RB) and restricted interests (RI) were genetically independent of each other. The polygenic risk score (PRS) for ASD as categorical diagnosis explained 2.3-3.3% of the variance of SI, joint attention (JA), and PI, 4.5% for RI, 1.2% of RB, but only 0.7% of NVC. We report eight genome-wide significant hits-partially replicating previous findings-and 292 known and novel candidate genes. The underlying biological mechanisms were related to neuronal transmission and development. At the SNP and gene level, all subdomains showed overlap, with the exception of RB. However, no overlap was observed at the functional level. In summary, the ADI-R algorithm-derived subdomains related to social communication show a shared genetic etiology in contrast to restricted and repetitive behaviors. The ASD-specific PRS overlapped only partially, suggesting an additional role of specific common variation in shaping the phenotypic expression of ASD subdomains.},

However, the neural action of CBD, and its relevance to ASD, remains unclear. We and others have previously shown that response to drug challenge can be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), but that pharmacological responsivity is atypical in ASD.<h4>Aims</h4>We hypothesized that there would be a (different) fMRI response to CBD in ASD.<h4>Methods</h4>To test this, task-free fMRI was acquired in 34 healthy men (half with ASD) following oral administration of 600 mg CBD or matched placebo (random order; double-blind administration). The 'fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations' (fALFF) was measured across the whole brain, and, where CBD significantly altered fALFF, we tested if functional connectivity (FC) of those regions was also affected by CBD.<h4>Results</h4>CBD significantly increased fALFF in the cerebellar vermis and the right fusiform gyrus. However, post-hoc within-group analyses revealed that this effect was primarily driven by the ASD group, with no significant change in controls. Within the ASD group only, CBD also significantly altered vermal FC with several of its subcortical (striatal) and cortical targets, but did not affect fusiform FC with other regions in either group.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our results suggest that, especially in ASD, CBD alters regional fALFF and FC in/between regions consistently implicated in ASD. Future studies should examine if this affects the complex behaviours these regions modulate.},

The present study aimed to explore acquired capability as the mediator of increased suicide risk conferred by NSSI in autistic and non-autistic adults.<h4>Methods</h4>Autistic and non-autistic adults (n = 314, n = 312) completed an online survey exploring lifetime suicide attempts, experience with NSSI, and acquired capability for suicide. We explored relationships between lifetime incidence of NSSI and lifetime suicide attempts via three facets of acquired capability (pain tolerance, reduced fear of death, and mental rehearsal of suicide). In self-harming participants (224 autistic and 156 non-autistic), we explored whether particular types and features of NSSI might be especially associated with capability and through that with suicide: namely engagement in scratching, cutting, and self-hitting, and engaging in more numerous forms of NSSI.<h4>Results</h4>While a higher frequency of NSSI was associated with all three facets of acquired capability, only reduced fear of death and mental rehearsal of suicide mediated an indirect relationship with lifetime suicide attempts. NSSI also directly predicted more numerous suicide attempts. Autistic people tended towards reduced fear of death and mental rehearsal regardless of NSSI status. Among self-harming autistic and non-autistic participants, cutting and an increased number of NSSI behaviours were associated with lifetime suicide attempts directly and indirectly via acquired capability. In both groups, self-hitting was associated with lifetime suicide attempts only via acquired capability.<h4>Limitations</h4>Our cross-sectional methodology negates inferences of directionality. While we controlled for age, our samples were poorly matched, with the autistic group two times older on average. The autistic sample, predominantly late-diagnosed, female and highly qualified, were unrepresentative of the whole autistic community.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our data suggest that acquired capability, as measured herein, is an incomplete explanation for the association between NSSI and suicide risk. A broader construct with stable and transient facets may offer greater explanatory power, but it is probable that other variables explain or provide additional means through which this association arises.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Lay abstract</h4>Restricted interests and repetitive behaviours are central to the diagnosis of autism and can have profound effects on daily activities and quality of life. These challenges are also linked to other co-occurring conditions such as anxiety and sensory sensitivities. Here, we looked at whether early emerging signs of anxiety and sensory problems appear before symptoms of autism by studying infants with a family history of autism, as these infants are more likely to develop autism themselves. Studying infant siblings provides an opportunity for researchers to focus on early developmental markers of autism as these infants can be followed from birth. This study found that early infant signs of anxiety (e.g. fear/shyness) predicted later perceptual sensitivity, and those infants who scored higher on fear/shyness and sensitivity were more likely to experience more persistent repetitive behaviours, but also social and communication difficulties in toddlerhood. Early signs of anxiety and perceptual sensitivity may thus relate to both later social difficulties and repetitive behaviours. These findings support the importance of further research exploring the causal links between these domains in relation to autism, resulting in increased understanding of children who go onto develop autism in the future and guiding early interventions and supports.},

	Abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that is accompanied by neurodevelopmental differences in regional cortical volume (CV), and a potential layer-specific pathology. Conventional measures of CV, however, do not indicate how volume is distributed across cortical layers. In a sample of 92 typically developing (TD) controls and 92 adult individuals with ASD (aged 18-52 years), we examined volumetric gradients by quantifying the degree to which CV is weighted from the pial to the white surface of the brain. Overall, the spatial distribution of Frustum Surface Ratio (FSR) followed the gyral and sulcal pattern of the cortex and approximated a bimodal Gaussian distribution caused by a linear mixture of vertices on gyri and sulci. Measures of FSR were highly correlated with vertex-wise estimates of mean curvature, sulcal depth, and pial surface area, although none of these features explained more than 76% variability in FSR on their own. Moreover, in ASD, we observed a pattern of predominant increases in the degree of FSR relative to TD controls, with an atypical neurodevelopmental trajectory. Our findings suggest a more outward-weighted gradient of CV in ASD, which may indicate a larger contribution of supragranular layers to regional differences in CV.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Placebo response in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) might dilute drug-placebo differences and hinder drug development. Therefore, this meta-analysis investigated placebo response in core symptoms.<h4>Methods</h4>We searched ClinicalTrials.gov , CENTRAL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, WHO-ICTRP (up to July 8, 2018), and PubMed (up to July 4, 2019) for randomized pharmacological and dietary supplement placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) with a minimum of seven days of treatment. Single-group meta-analyses were conducted using a random-effects model. Standardized mean changes (SMC) of core symptoms in placebo arms were the primary outcomes and placebo positive response rates were a secondary outcome. Predictors of placebo response were investigated with meta-regression analyses. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO ID CRD42019125317 .<h4>Results</h4>Eighty-six RCTs with 2360 participants on placebo were included in our analysis (87% in children/adolescents). The majority of trials were small, single-center with a duration of 8-12 weeks and published after 2009. Placebo response in social-communication difficulties was SMC = - 0.32, 95% CI [- 0.39, - 0.25], in repetitive behaviors - 0.23[- 0.32, - 0.15] and in scales measuring overall core symptoms - 0.36 [- 0.46, - 0.26]. Overall, 19%, 95% CI [16-22%] of participants were at least much improved with placebo. Caregiver (vs. clinician) ratings, lower risk of bias, flexible-dosing, larger sample sizes and number of sites, less recent publication year, baseline levels of irritability, and the use of a threshold of core symptoms at inclusion were associated with larger placebo response in at least a core symptom domain.<h4>Limitations</h4>About 40% of the trials had an apparent focus on core symptoms. Investigation of the differential impact of predictors on placebo and drug response was impeded by the use of diverse experimental interventions with essentially different mechanisms of action. An individual-participant-data meta-analysis could allow for a more fine-grained analysis and provide more informative answers.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Placebo response in ASD was substantial and predicted by design- and participant-related factors, which could inform the design of future trials in order to improve the detection of efficacy in core symptoms. Potential solutions could be the minimization and careful selection of study sites as well as rigorous participant enrollment and the use of measurements of change not solely dependent on caregivers.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Backgrounds</h4>Atypicalities in tactile processing are reported in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) but it remains unknown if they precede and associate with the traits of these disorders emerging in childhood. We investigated behavioural and neural markers of tactile sensory processing in infants at elevated likelihood of ASD and/or ADHD compared to infants at typical likelihood of the disorders. Further, we assessed the specificity of associations between infant markers and later ASD or ADHD traits.<h4>Methods</h4>Ninety-one 10-month-old infants participated in the study (n = 44 infants at elevated likelihood of ASD; n = 20 infants at elevated likelihood of ADHD; n = 9 infants at elevated likelihood of ASD and ADHD; n = 18 infants at typical likelihood of the disorders). Behavioural and EEG responses to pairs of tactile stimuli were experimentally recorded and concurrent parental reports of tactile responsiveness were collected. ASD and ADHD traits were measured at 24 months through standardized assessment (ADOS-2) and parental report (ECBQ), respectively.<h4>Results</h4>There was no effect of infants' likelihood status on behavioural markers of tactile sensory processing. Conversely, increased ASD likelihood associated with reduced neural repetition suppression to tactile input. Reduced neural repetition suppression at 10 months significantly predicted ASD (but not ADHD) traits at 24 months across the entire sample. Elevated tactile sensory seeking at 10 months moderated the relationship between early reduced neural repetition suppression and later ASD traits.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Reduced tactile neural repetition suppression is an early marker of later ASD traits in infants at elevated likelihood of ASD or ADHD, suggesting that a common pathway to later ASD traits exists despite different familial backgrounds. Elevated tactile sensory seeking may act as a protective factor, mitigating the relationship between early tactile neural repetition suppression and later ASD traits.},

	Abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly complex neurodevelopmental condition that is accompanied by neuroanatomical differences on the macroscopic and microscopic level. Findings from histological, genetic, and more recently in vivo neuroimaging studies converge in suggesting that neuroanatomical abnormalities, specifically around the gray-white matter (GWM) boundary, represent a crucial feature of ASD. However, no research has yet characterized the GWM boundary in ASD based on measures of diffusion. Here, we registered diffusion tensor imaging data to the structural T1-weighted images of 92 adults with ASD and 92 matched neurotypical controls in order to examine between-group differences and group-by-sex interactions in fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity sampled at the GWM boundary, and at different sampling depths within the superficial white and into the gray matter. As hypothesized, we observed atypical diffusion at and around the GWM boundary in ASD, with between-group differences and group-by-sex interactions depending on tissue class and sampling depth. Furthermore, we identified that altered diffusion at the GWM boundary partially (i.e., ~50%) overlapped with atypical gray-white matter tissue contrast in ASD. Our study thus replicates and extends previous work highlighting the GWM boundary as a crucial target of neuropathology in ASD, and guides future work elucidating etiological mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by repetitive behaviors and impairments of sociability and communication. About 1% of ASD cases are caused by mutations of <i>SHANK3</i>, a major scaffolding protein of the postsynaptic density. We studied the role of SHANK3 in plastic changes of excitatory synapses within the central nervous system by employing mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in WT and <i>Shank3</i> knockout mice. In WT mice, mTBI triggered ipsi- and contralateral loss of hippocampal dendritic spines and excitatory synapses with a partial recovery over time. In contrast, no significant synaptic alterations were detected in <i>Shank3</i>∆<i>11-/-</i> mice, which showed fewer dendritic spines and excitatory synapses at baseline. In line, mTBI induced the upregulation of synaptic plasticity-related proteins Arc and p-cofilin only in WT mice. Interestingly, microglia proliferation was observed in WT mice after mTBI but not in <i>Shank3</i>∆<i>11-/-</i> mice. Finally, we detected TBI-induced increased fear memory at the behavioral level, whereas in <i>Shank3</i>∆<i>11-/-</i> animals, the already-enhanced fear memory levels increased only slightly after mTBI. Our data show the lack of structural synaptic plasticity in <i>Shank3</i> knockout mice that might explain at least in part the rigidity of behaviors, problems in adjusting to new situations and cognitive deficits seen in ASDs.},

	Abstract = {A female advantage in social cognition (SoC) might contribute to women's underrepresentation in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The latter could be underpinned by sex differences in social brain structure. This study investigated the relationship between structural social brain networks and SoC in females and males in relation to ASD and autistic traits in twins. We used a co-twin design in 77 twin pairs (39 female) aged 12.5 to 31.0 years. Twin pairs were discordant or concordant for ASD or autistic traits, discordant or concordant for other neurodevelopmental disorders or concordant for neurotypical development. They underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging and were assessed for SoC using the naturalistic Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition. Autistic traits predicted reduced SoC capacities predominantly in male twins, despite a comparable extent of autistic traits in each sex, although the association between SoC and autistic traits did not differ significantly between the sexes. Consistently, within-pair associations between SoC and social brain structure revealed that lower SoC ability was associated with increased cortical thickness of several brain regions, particularly in males. Our findings confirm the notion that sex differences in SoC in association with ASD are underpinned by sex differences in brain structure.},

	Abstract = {Heterozygous mutations of the gene encoding the postsynaptic protein SHANK3 are associated with syndromic forms of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). One of the earliest clinical symptoms in SHANK3-associated ASD is neonatal skeletal muscle hypotonia. This symptom can be critical for the early diagnosis of affected children; however, the mechanism mediating hypotonia in ASD is not completely understood. Here, we used a combination of patient-derived human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), <i>Shank3</i>Δ<i>11(-/-)</i> mice, and Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMDS) muscle biopsies from patients of different ages to analyze the role of SHANK3 on motor unit development. Our results suggest that the hypotonia in SHANK3 deficiency might be caused by dysfunctions in all elements of the voluntary motor system: motoneurons, neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), and striated muscles. We found that SHANK3 localizes in Z-discs in the skeletal muscle sarcomere and co-immunoprecipitates with α-ACTININ. SHANK3 deficiency lead to shortened Z-discs and severe impairment of acetylcholine receptor clustering in hiPSC-derived myotubes and in muscle from <i>Shank3</i>Δ<i>11(-/-)</i> mice and patients with PMDS, indicating a crucial role for SHANK3 in the maturation of NMJs and striated muscle. Functional motor defects in <i>Shank3</i>Δ<i>11(-/-)</i> mice could be rescued with the troponin activator Tirasemtiv that sensitizes muscle fibers to calcium. Our observations give insight into the function of SHANK3 besides the central nervous system and imply potential treatment strategies for SHANK3-associated ASD.},

Better understanding of these patterns can help clinicians identify strategies to reduce substance use, protecting physical and mental health. The aim of this study was to compare the experiences of substance use between autistic and non-autistic adolescents and adults.<h4>Methods</h4>This study is a mixed-methods study, including both quantitative (closed-ended questions) and qualitative (one open-ended question) online assessments. Data were collected as part of a larger study, the Autism and Physical Health Survey, in which we administered an anonymised, online questionnaire to autistic and non-autistic individuals aged 16-90 years. In the present study, we investigated data on substance use or misuse, using two overlapping but separate samples from the survey (one sample with complete quantitative responses and one sample with complete qualitative responses). Binary measures of substance use were investigated using unadjusted and adjusted binomial logistic regression models. Content analysis was used to compare experiences of autistic and non-autistic adolescents and adults. We used Fisher's exact tests to assess differences in frequency of reporting particular qualitative themes and subthemes.<h4>Findings</h4>Survey recruitment was done between Feb 7, 2018, and Aug 26, 2019. At the end of the recruitment, 3657 individuals had accessed the survey. After excluding duplicates as well as participants with missing or incomplete responses, we had data from 2386 participants (1183 autistic and 1203 non-autistic participants; 1571 female and 815 male participants) for the quantitative analyses and data from 919 participants (429 autistic and 490 non-autistic participants; 569 female and 350 male participants) in the qualitative analyses. The samples for the quantitative and qualitative analyses were predominantly composed of female individuals, White individuals, UK residents, and those without intellectual disability. Autistic individuals were less likely than non-autistic individuals to report consuming alcohol regularly (16·0% of autistic individuals vs 22·2% of non-autistic individuals; adjusted model: odds ratio [OR] 0·69, 95% CI 0·55-0·86; p=0·0022) or binge-drinking (3·8% vs 8·2%; adjusted model: OR 0·38, 0·26-0·56; p<0·0001). Autistic male participants were less likely than non-autistic male participants to report ever having smoked (50·8% of autistic male participants vs 64·6% of non-autistic male participants; adjusted OR 0·50; 0·32-0·76; p=0·0022) or ever using drugs (35·4% vs 52·7%; adjusted OR 0·53; 0·35-0·80; p=0·0022). Regarding our qualitative analyses, among participants who reported a specific motivation for drug use, compared with non-autistic individuals, autistic individuals were nearly nine times more likely to report using recreational substances to manage behaviour (OR 8·89, 2·05-81·12; p=0·0017) and more likely to report using recreational substances to manage mental health symptoms (OR 3·08, 1·18-9·08; p=0·032). Autistic individuals were also more likely to report vulnerability associated with substance use (OR 4·16, 1·90-10·05; p=0·00027), including childhood use of drugs and being forced or tricked into using drugs.<h4>Interpretation</h4>Autistic individuals might be less likely than non-autistic individuals to report engaging in substance misuse. They also report using drugs to self-medicate. Clinicians should be aware of vulnerability linked to substance use among autistic patients and should work cooperatively with patients to effectively manage autistic and comorbid symptoms.<h4>Funding</h4>Autism Research Trust, Rosetrees Trust, Cambridge and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust.},

Shank2 is a high-confidence ASD candidate gene and localizes primarily to postsynaptic densities (PSDs) of excitatory synapses in the central nervous system (CNS). We show here that loss of Shank2 in mice leads to a lack of social attachment and bonding behavior towards pubs independent of hormonal, cognitive, or sensitive deficits. Shank2<sup>-/-</sup> mice display functional changes in nuclei of the social attachment circuit that were most prominent in the medial preoptic area (MPOA) of the hypothalamus. Selective enhancement of MPOA activity by DREADD technology re-established social bonding behavior in Shank2<sup>-/-</sup> mice, providing evidence that the identified circuit might be crucial for explaining how social deficits in ASD can arise.},

	Abstract = {Maternal immune activation (MIA) is mediated by activation of inflammatory pathways resulting in increased levels of cytokines and chemokines that cross the placental and blood-brain barriers altering fetal neural development. Maternal viral infection is one of the most well-known causes for immune activation in pregnant women. MIA and immune abnormalities are key players in the etiology of developmental conditions such as autism, schizophrenia, ADHD, and depression. Experimental evidence implicating MIA in with different effects in the offspring is complex. For decades, scientists have relied on either MIA models or human epidemiological data or a combination of both. MIA models are generated using infection/pathogenic agents to induce an immunological reaction in rodents and monitor the effects. Human epidemiological studies investigate a link between maternal infection and/or high levels of cytokines in pregnant mothers and the likelihood of developing conditions. In this review, we discuss the importance of understanding the relationship between virus-mediated MIA and neurodevelopmental conditions, focusing on autism and schizophrenia. We further discuss the different methods of studying MIA and their limitations and focus on the different factors contributing to MIA heterogeneity.},

	Abstract = {Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and early-onset psychosis (EOP) are neurodevelopmental disorders that share genetic, clinical and cognitive facets; it is unclear if these disorders also share spatially overlapping cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA) abnormalities. MRI scans of 30 ASD, 29 patients with early-onset first-episode psychosis (EO-FEP) and 26 typically developing controls (TD) (age range 10-18 years) were analyzed by the FreeSurfer suite to calculate vertex-wise estimates of CT, SA, and cortical volume. Two publicly available datasets of ASD and EOP (age range 7-18 years and 5-17 years, respectively) were used for replication analysis. ASD and EO-FEP had spatially overlapping areas of cortical thinning and reduced SA in the bilateral insula (all p's < .00002); 37% of all left insular vertices presenting with significant cortical thinning and 20% (left insula) and 61% (right insula) of insular vertices displaying decreased SA overlapped across both disorders. In both disorders, SA deficits contributed more to cortical volume decreases than reductions in CT did. This finding, as well as the novel finding of an absence of spatial overlap (for ASD) or marginal overlap (for EOP) of deficits in CT and SA, was replicated in the two nonoverlapping independent samples. The insula appears to be a region with transdiagnostic vulnerability for deficits in CT and SA. The finding of nonexistent or small spatial overlap between CT and SA deficits in young people with ASD and psychosis may point to the involvement of common aberrant early neurodevelopmental mechanisms in their pathophysiology.},

	Abstract = {Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by deficits in social interaction and communication, and repetitive behaviors. In addition, co-morbidities such as gastro-intestinal problems have frequently been reported. Mutations and deletion of proteins of the SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains (<i>SHANK</i>) gene-family were identified in patients with ASD, and <i>Shank</i> knock-out mouse models display autism-like phenotypes. SHANK3 proteins are not only expressed in the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we show expression in gastrointestinal (GI) epithelium and report a significantly different GI morphology in <i>Shank3</i> knock-out (KO) mice. Further, we detected a significantly altered microbiota composition measured in feces of <i>Shank3</i> KO mice that may contribute to inflammatory responses affecting brain development. In line with this, we found higher <i>E. coli</i> lipopolysaccharide levels in liver samples of <i>Shank3</i> KO mice, and detected an increase in Interleukin-6 and activated astrocytes in <i>Shank3</i> KO mice. We conclude that apart from its well-known role in the CNS, SHANK3 plays a specific role in the GI tract that may contribute to the ASD phenotype by extracerebral mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Autism is a lifelong neurodevelopmental difference and disability, yet there is limited research examining parenting in autistic mothers.<h4>Objective</h4>To explore autistic mothers' experience of the perinatal period and parenthood. This includes pregnancy, childbirth, the postpartum period, self-perception of parenting strengths and weaknesses, communication with professionals in relation to one's child, mental health difficulties and the social experience of motherhood. It also includes disclosing one's diagnosis of autism in parenting contexts.<h4>Methods</h4>We used a community-based participatory research model, and recruited an advisory panel, with whom we co-developed an anonymous, online survey for autistic mothers. The online survey was completed by autistic and non-autistic mothers, and we compared their responses using Chi-squared analysis.<h4>Sample</h4>Autistic mothers (<i>n</i> = 355), and non-autistic mothers (<i>n</i> = 132), each of whom had at least one autistic child, were included in our final analysis.<h4>Results</h4>There were differences in education, gender identity and age of mother at birth of first child. Autistic mothers were more likely to have experienced additional psychiatric conditions, including pre- or post-partum depression, and reported greater difficulties in areas such as multi-tasking, coping with domestic responsibilities and creating social opportunities for their child. They were also more likely to report feeling misunderstood by professionals, and reported greater anxiety, higher rates of selective mutism, and not knowing which details were appropriate to share with professionals. They were also more likely to find motherhood an isolating experience, to worry about others judging their parenting, or feel unable to turn to others for support in parenting. However, despite these challenges, autistic mothers were able to act in the best interest of their child, putting their child's needs first.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Autistic mothers face unique challenges and the stigma associated with autism may further exacerbate communication difficulties. Greater understanding and acceptance amongst individuals who interact with autistic mothers is needed, and autistic mothers would benefit from additional and better-tailored support.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Altered resting-state functional connectivity in the default mode network (DMN) is characteristic of both autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Standard analytical pipelines for resting-state functional connectivity focus on linear correlations in activation time courses between neural networks or regions of interest. These features may be insensitive to temporally lagged or nonlinear relationships.<h4>Methods</h4>In a twin cohort study comprising 292 children, including 52 with a diagnosis of ASD and 70 with a diagnosis of ADHD, we applied nonlinear analytical methods to characterize periodic dynamics in the DMN. Using recurrence quantification analysis and related methods, we measured the prevalence, duration, and complexity of periodic processes within and between DMN regions of interest. We constructed generalized estimating equations to compare these features between neurotypical children and children with ASD and/or ADHD while controlling for familial relationships, and we leveraged machine learning algorithms to construct models predictive of ASD or ADHD diagnosis.<h4>Results</h4>In within-pair analyses of twins with discordant ASD diagnoses, we found that DMN signal dynamics were significantly different in dizygotic twins but not in monozygotic twins. Considering our full sample, we found that these patterns allowed a robust predictive classification of both ASD (81.0% accuracy; area under the curve = 0.85) and ADHD (82% accuracy; area under the curve = 0.87) cases.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These findings indicate that synchronized periodicity among regions comprising the DMN relates both to neurotypical function and to ASD and/or ADHD, and they suggest generally that a dynamical analysis of network interconnectivity may be a useful methodology for future neuroimaging studies.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies in autism spectrum disorder (autism) have yielded diverging results. This might partly be attributed to structural alterations being associating with the combined influence of several regions rather than with a single region. Further, these structural covariation differences may relate to continuous measures of autism rather than with categorical case-control contrasts. The current study aimed to identify structural covariation alterations in autism, and assessed canonical correlations between brain covariation patterns and core autism symptoms.<h4>Methods</h4>We studied 347 individuals with autism and 252 typically developing individuals, aged between 6 and 30 years, who have been deeply phenotyped in the Longitudinal European Autism Project. All participants' VBM maps were decomposed into spatially independent components using independent component analysis. A generalized linear model (GLM) was used to examine case-control differences. Next, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was performed to separately explore the integrated effects between all the brain sources of gray matter variation and two sets of core autism symptoms.<h4>Results</h4>GLM analyses showed significant case-control differences for two independent components. The first component was primarily associated with decreased density of bilateral insula, inferior frontal gyrus, orbitofrontal cortex, and increased density of caudate nucleus in the autism group relative to typically developing individuals. The second component was related to decreased densities of the bilateral amygdala, hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus in the autism group relative to typically developing individuals. The CCA results showed significant correlations between components that involved variation of thalamus, putamen, precentral gyrus, frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes, and the cerebellum, and repetitive, rigid and stereotyped behaviors and abnormal sensory behaviors in autism individuals.<h4>Limitations</h4>Only 55.9% of the participants with autism had complete questionnaire data on continuous parent-reported symptom measures.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Covaried areas associated with autism diagnosis and/or symptoms are scattered across the whole brain and include the limbic system, basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum, precentral gyrus, and parts of the frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes. Some of these areas potentially subserve social-communicative behavior, whereas others may underpin sensory processing and integration, and motor behavior.},

	Abstract = {Early difficulties in engaging attentive brain states in social settings could affect learning and have cascading effects on social development. We investigated this possibility using multichannel electroencephalography during a face/non-face paradigm in 8-month-old infants with (FH, n = 91) and without (noFH, n = 40) a family history of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). An event-related potential component reflecting attention engagement, the Nc, was compared between FH infants who received a diagnosis of ASD at 3 years of age (FH-ASD; n = 19), FH infants who did not (FH-noASD; n = 72) and noFH infants (who also did not, hereafter noFH-noASD; n = 40). 'Prototypical' microstates during social attention were extracted from the noFH-noASD group and examined in relation to later categorical and dimensional outcome. Machine-learning was used to identify the microstate features that best predicted ASD and social adaptive skills at three years. Results suggested that whilst measures of brain state timing were related to categorical ASD outcome, brain state strength was related to dimensional measures of social functioning. Specifically, the FH-ASD group showed shorter Nc latency relative to other groups, and duration of the attentive microstate responses to faces was informative for categorical outcome prediction. Reduced Nc amplitude difference between faces with direct gaze and a non-social control stimulus and strength of the attentive microstate to faces contributed to the prediction of dimensional variation in social skills. Taken together, this provides consistent evidence that atypical attention engagement precedes the emergence of difficulties in socialization and indicates that using the spatio-temporal characteristics of whole-brain activation to define brain states in infancy provides an important new approach to understanding of the neurodevelopmental mechanisms that lead to ASD.},

	Abstract = {Previous studies have identified differences in DNA methylation in autistic individuals compared to neurotypical individuals. Yet, it is unclear if this extends to autistic traits-subclinical manifestation of autism features in the general population. Here, we investigate the association between DNA methylation at birth (cord blood), and scores on the Social and Communication Disorders Checklist (SCDC), a measure of autistic traits, in 701 8-year-olds, by conducting a methylome-wide association study (MWAS). We did not identify significant CpGs associated with SCDC. The most significant CpG site was cg14379490, on chromosome 9 (MWAS beta = - 1.78 ± 0.35, <i>p</i> value = 5.34 × 10 <sup><i>-7</i></sup> ). Using methylation data for autism in peripheral tissues, we did not identify a significant concordance in effect direction of CpGs with <i>p</i> value < 10<sup>-4</sup> in the SCDC MWAS (binomial sign test, <i>p</i> value > 0.5). In contrast, using methylation data for autism from post-mortem brain tissues, we identify a significant concordance in effect direction of CpGs with a <i>p</i> value < 10<sup>-4</sup> in the SCDC MWAS (binomial sign test, <i>p</i> value = 0.004). Supporting this, we observe an enrichment for genes that are dysregulated in the post-mortem autism brain (one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test, <i>p</i> value = 6.22 × 10<sup>-5</sup>). Finally, integrating genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for autism (<i>n</i> = 46,350) with mQTL maps from cord-blood (<i>n</i> = 771), we demonstrate that mQTLs of CpGs associated with SCDC scores at <i>p</i> value thresholds of 0.01 and 0.005 are significantly shifted toward lower <i>p</i> values in the GWAS for autism (<i>p</i> < 5 × 10<sup>-3</sup>). We provide additional support for this using a GWAS of SCDC, and demonstrate a lack of enrichment in a GWAS of Alzheimer's disease. Our results highlight the shared cross-tissue methylation architecture of autism and autistic traits, and demonstrate that mQTLs associated with differences in DNA methylation associated with childhood autistic traits are enriched for common genetic variants associated with autism and autistic traits.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>In typical infant development, parents and their children jointly contribute to establishing frequent episodes of joint attention that boost language acquisition and shape social cognition. Here we used novel live eye-tracking technology to evaluate the degree to which autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is related to reduced responding to others' joint attention bids in infancy (RJA) and to a reduced tendency to initiate joint attention episodes (IJA). Because young infants use their gaze for both RJA and IJA, this approach allowed us to quantify these elusive processes early in life.<h4>Methods</h4>The final sample consisted of 112 infants (54 boys and 58 girls), of whom 81 were at familial risk for ASD and 31 were typically developing low-risk infants. At follow-up (36 months of age), 22 children in the high-risk group were diagnosed with ASD.<h4>Results</h4>At 10 months of age, rates of IJA were lower in infants later diagnosed with ASD than in the comparison groups (effect sizes d = 0.78-0.95) and followed an atypical developmental trajectory from 10 to 18 months (p < .002). RJA distinguished infants based on familial ASD risk, albeit not ASD diagnosis. The differences in IJA could not be explained by overall looking time, social preference, eye movement latencies, or number of fixations.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This live eye-tracking study suggests that during an important period for the development of social cognition (10-18 months of age), infants later diagnosed with ASD show marked atypicalities in IJA but not in RJA. The results indicate that IJA is an important target for future prodromal intervention trials.},

However, development and implementation of inclusive education (IE) is considered difficult. This paper identifies conditions that facilitate IE development for children with autism in the European Union and benchmarks to track IE policy development. Education policy data from 30 legislative regions in the European Union were analyzed through a qualitative comparative analysis using eight conditions: a definition of SEN, the right to education for children with SEN, support for teaching staff, support services for children with SEN, individualized learning outcomes, parental involvement, and mixed mainstream classes. The right to education for children with SEN is implemented in all regions under study. Seven of the examined conditions were associated with IE: an established definition of SEN, support for teaching staff, support services for children with SEN, individualized learning outcomes, parental involvement, IE policies, and mixed mainstream classrooms. Mixed classrooms and support services for children with SEN were identified as necessary for IE. IE policies and support for teaching staff were present in all scenarios that facilitated IE. While the analysis was initially focused on autism, the policies consisted predominantly of general SEN policies, allowing the results to be interpreted in a wider context, beyond autism. Ultimately, mixed mainstream classrooms and support services for children with special needs were found essential for consistent IE development. Support for teaching staff and IE policies facilitate IE and should be further explored and implemented.},

However, no published work has examined the development of face processing abilities from infancy into the school-age years and how they relate to ASD symptoms in individuals with or at high-risk for ASD. In this novel study we investigated neural and behavioural measures of face processing at age 7 months and again in mid-childhood (age 7 years) as well as social-communication and sensory symptoms in siblings at high (n = 42) and low (n = 35) familial risk for ASD. In mid-childhood, high-risk siblings showed atypical P1 and N170 event-related potential correlates of face processing and, for high-risk boys only, poorer face and object recognition ability compared to low-risk siblings. These neural and behavioural atypicalities were associated with each other and with higher social-communication and sensory symptoms in mid-childhood. Additionally, more atypical neural correlates of object (but not face) processing in infancy were associated with less right-lateralised (more atypical) N170 amplitudes and greater social-communication problems in mid-childhood. The implications for models of face processing in ASD are discussed.},

Features of brain dynamics have been linked to emotion and cognition in adult individuals, and atypical patterns have been associated with neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism. Although reliable functional brain networks have been consistently identified in neonates, little is known about the early development of dynamic functional connectivity. In this study we characterise dynamic functional connectivity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in the first few weeks of postnatal life in term-born (n = 324) and preterm-born (n = 66) individuals. We show that a dynamic landscape of brain connectivity is already established by the time of birth in the human brain, characterised by six transient states of neonatal functional connectivity with changing dynamics through the neonatal period. The pattern of dynamic connectivity is atypical in preterm-born infants, and associated with atypical social, sensory, and repetitive behaviours measured by the Quantitative Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (Q-CHAT) scores at 18 months of age.},

	Abstract = {Accumulating evidence suggests that functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) can provide an essential bridge between our current understanding of neural circuit organization and cortical activity in the developing brain. Indeed, fNIRS allows studying brain functions through the measurement of neurovascular coupling that links neural activity to subsequent changes in cerebral blood flow and hemoglobin oxygenation levels. While the literature offers a multitude of fNIRS applications to typical development, only recently this tool has been extended to the study of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). The exponential rise of scientific publications on this topic during the last years reflects the interest to identify a "fNIRS signature" as a biomarker of high translational value to support both early clinical diagnosis and treatment outcome. The purpose of this systematic review is to describe the updating clinical applications of fNIRS in NDDs, with a specific focus on preschool population. Starting from this rationale, a systematic search was conducted for relevant studies in different scientific databases (Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Science) resulting in 13 published articles. In these studies, fNIRS was applied in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or infants at high risk of developing ASD. Both functional connectivity in resting-state conditions and task-evoked brain activation using multiple experimental paradigms were used in the selected investigations, suggesting that fNIRS might be considered a promising method for identifying early quantitative biomarkers in the autism field.},

	Abstract = {Co-morbid mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression are extremely common in autistic adults. Vulnerability to negative life experiences such as victimisation and unemployment may be partially responsible for the development of these conditions. Here we measure the frequency of negative life experiences in autistic adults and explore how these are associated with current anxiety and depression symptoms and life satisfaction. We developed the Vulnerability Experiences Quotient (VEQ) through stakeholder consultation. The VEQ includes 60 items across 10 domains. Autistic adults with a clinical diagnosis and non-autistic controls completed the VEQ, screening measures for anxiety and depression, and a life-satisfaction scale in an online survey. Likelihood of experiencing each VEQ event was compared between groups, using binary logistic regression. Mediation analysis was used to test whether total VEQ score mediated the relationship between autism and (1) depression (2) anxiety and (3) life satisfaction. Autistic adults (N = 426) reported higher rates of the majority of events in the VEQ than non-autistic adults (N = 268). They also reported more anxiety and depression symptoms and lower life satisfaction. Group differences in anxiety, depression and life satisfaction were partially mediated by VEQ total score. This study highlights several important understudied areas of vulnerability for autistic adults, including domestic abuse, contact with social services (as parents) and financial exploitation and hardship. Improved support, advice and advocacy services are needed to reduce the vulnerability of autistic adults to negative life experiences, which may in turn improve mental health and life satisfaction in this population. Autism Res 2019, 12: 1516-1528. © 2019 The Authors. Autism Research published by International Society for Autism Research published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: This study investigated whether autistic adults are more vulnerable to certain negative life experiences, and whether these experiences are related to anxiety, depression and life satisfaction. We found that autistic adults are more vulnerable to many different negative life events, including employment difficulties, financial hardship and domestic abuse. Negative life experiences partially explained the higher rates of anxiety and depression symptoms and lower life satisfaction in autistic adults compared to non-autistic adults. Improved support services are required to reduce the vulnerability of autistic adults. Reducing vulnerability may improve mental health and increase life satisfaction in this population.},

We used eye-tracking to capture the PLR in 216 infants in a longitudinal follow-up study spanning 5 to 24 months of age, and linear mixed models to investigate effects of age and group on three PLR parameters: baseline pupil diameter, latency to constriction and relative constriction amplitude. An increase with age was found in baseline pupil diameter (F(3,273.21) = 13.15, p < 0.001, [Formula: see text] = 0.13), latency to constriction (F(3,326.41) = 3.84, p = 0.010, [Formula: see text] = 0.03) and relative constriction amplitude(F(3,282.53) = 3.70, p = 0.012, [Formula: see text] = 0.04). Group differences were found for baseline pupil diameter (F(3,235.91) = 9.40, p < 0.001, [Formula: see text] = 0.11), with larger diameter in preterms and siblings than in controls, and for latency to constriction (F(3,237.10) = 3.48, p = 0.017, [Formula: see text] = 0.04), with preterms having a longer latency than controls. The results align with previous evidence, with development over time that could be explained by ANS maturation. To better understand the cause of the group differences, further research in a larger sample is necessary, combining pupillometry with other measures to further validate its value.},

	Abstract = {EU-AIMS is the largest European research program aiming to identify stratification biomarkers and novel interventions for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Within the program, the Longitudinal European Autism Project (LEAP) has recruited and comprehensively phenotyped a rare sample of 76 monozygotic and dizygotic twins, discordant, or concordant for ASD plus 30 typically developing twins. The aim of this letter is to complete previous descriptions of the LEAP case-control sample, clinically characterize, and investigate the suitability of the sample for ASD twin-control analyses purposes and share some 'lessons learnt.' Among the twins, a diagnosis of ASD is associated with increased symptom levels of ADHD, higher rates of intellectual disability, and lower family income. For the future, we conclude that the LEAP twin cohort offers multiple options for analyses of genetic and shared and non-shared environmental factors to generate new hypotheses for the larger cohort of LEAP singletons, but particularly cross-validate and refine evidence from it.},

Positing a causal role for sensory processing differences requires observing atypical sensory reactivity prior to the emergence of other symptoms, which can be achieved through prospective studies.<h4>Methods</h4>In this longitudinal study, we examined auditory repetition suppression and change detection at 5 and 10 months in infants with and without Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1), a condition associated with higher likelihood of developing ASD.<h4>Results</h4>In typically developing infants, suppression to vowel repetition and enhanced responses to vowel/pitch change decreased with age over posterior regions, becoming more frontally specific; age-related change was diminished in the NF1 group. Whilst both groups detected changes in vowel and pitch, the NF1 group were largely slower to show a differentiated neural response. Auditory responses did not relate to later language, but were related to later ASD traits.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These findings represent the first demonstration of atypical brain responses to sounds in infants with NF1 and suggest they may relate to the likelihood of later ASD.},

	Abstract = {SHANK2 (ProSAP1) is a postsynaptic scaffolding protein of excitatory synapses in the central nervous system and implicated in the development of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Patients with mutations in <i>SHANK2</i> show autism-like behaviors, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. We generated human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) from a patient carrying a heterozygous deletion of <i>SHANK2</i> and from the unaffected parents. In patient hiPSCs and derived neurons <i>SHANK2</i> mRNA and protein expression was reduced. During neuronal maturation, a reduction in growth cone size and a transient increase in neuronal soma size were observed. Neuronal proliferation was increased, and apoptosis was decreased in young and mature neurons. Additionally, mature patient hiPSC-derived neurons showed dysregulated excitatory signaling and a decrease of a broad range of signaling molecules of the ERK-MAP kinase pathway. These findings could be confirmed in brain samples from <i>Shank2</i>(-/-) mice, which also showed decreased mGluR5 and phospho-ERK1/2 expression. Our study broadens the current knowledge of SHANK2-related ASD. We highlight the importance of excitatory-inhibitory balance and mGluR5 dysregulation with disturbed downstream ERK1/2 signaling in ASD, which provides possible future therapeutic strategies for SHANK2-related ASD.},

	Abstract = {Findings regarding sex differences in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as far as core symptoms and psychiatric comorbidities (PC) are concerned, are inconsistent, inconclusive, or conflicting among studies. The lower prevalence of ASD in females than in males and the age and intelligence quotient (IQ) heterogeneity among samples made it difficult to investigate these differences. This case-control study tries to deepen the impact of sex differences on core symptoms of autism and PC in 214 preschoolers with ASD (mean age, 45.26) without impairment in non-verbal IQ (nvIQ ≥70). A total of 107 ASD females (mean age, 44.51 ± 13.79 months) were matched one by one with 107 males (mean age, 46.01 ± 13.42 months) for chronological age (±6 months) and nvIQ (±6 points). We used the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule 2 (ADOS-2) and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) 1.5-5 to explore autism severity and PC. The results highlight that ASD females did not significantly differ from ASD males regarding the severity of autism. Statistically significant lower levels of emotionally reactive (<i>p</i> = 0.005, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.04), anxious-depressed (<i>p</i> = 0.001, <i>η</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.05), internalizing problems (<i>p</i> = 0.04, <i>η</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.02), and DSM-Oriented Scales anxiety problems (<i>p</i> = 0.02, <i>η</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.04) in ASD females than in ASD males were also detected. Our findings of no difference in the autism severity and lower internalizing problems in females than males with ASD extend the knowledge of autism in females during preschool years. Compared to other similar studies on this topic, we can state that these results are not supported by differences in nvIQ between sexes nor by the presence of cognitive impairment. It confirms the need for clinicians to consider sex differences when describing autism psychopathology.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Oxytocin administration, which may be of therapeutic value for individuals with social difficulties, is likely to affect endogenous levels of other socially relevant hormones. However, to date, the effects of oxytocin administration on endogenous hormones have only been examined in neurotypical individuals. The need to consider multi-hormone interactions is particularly warranted in oxytocin trials for autism due to evidence of irregularities in both oxytocin and sex steroid systems.<h4>Methods</h4>In this double-blind cross-over study, saliva samples were collected from 16 autistic and 29 neurotypical women before and after intranasal administration of 24 IU oxytocin or placebo. Oestradiol, testosterone, and oxytocin levels were quantified in saliva samples. Participants also completed the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) and Empathy Quotient (EQ) questionnaires.<h4>Results</h4>Distinct patterns of change in testosterone and oestradiol levels pre- to-post-administration were observed in autistic relative to neurotypical women (ANCOVA, p < 0.05 main effect of Group), controlling for sample collection time. The mean percent change oestradiol was + 8.8% for the autism group and - 13.0% for the neurotypical group (t = 1.81, p = 0.08), while the mean percent change testosterone was + 1.1% in the autism group and - 12.6% in the neurotypical group (t = 1.26, p = 0.22). In the oxytocin condition, the mean percent change oestradiol was + 12.6% in the autism group and - 6.9% in the neurotypical group (t = 1.78, p = 0.08), while the mean percent change testosterone was + 14.4% in the autism group and - 15.2% in the neurotypical group (t = 3.00, p = 0.006). Robust regression confirmed that group differences in percent change hormone levels were not driven by a small number of influential individuals. Baseline hormone levels did not differ between groups when considered individually. However, baseline testosterone relative to oestradiol (T:E2 ratio) was higher in autistic women (p = 0.023, Cohen's d = 0.63), and this ratio correlated positively and negatively with AQ and EQ scores, respectively, in the combined sample.<h4>Limitations</h4>Further studies with larger and more diverse autistic sample are warranted to confirm these effects.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study provides the first evidence that oxytocin influences endogenous testosterone levels in autistic individuals, with autistic women showing increases similar to previous reports of neurotypical men. These findings highlight the need to consider sex steroid hormones as a variable in future oxytocin trials.},

	Abstract = {Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS) is a syndromic form of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) classified as a rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorder featuring global developmental delay, absent or delayed speech, ASD-like behaviour and neonatal skeletal muscle hypotonia. PMS is caused by a heterozygous deletion of the distal end of chromosome 22q13.3 or <i>SHANK3</i> mutations. We analyzed striated muscles of newborn <i>Shank3Δ11(-/-)</i> animals and found a significant enlargement of the sarcoplasmic reticulum as previously seen in adult <i>Shank3Δ11(-/-)</i> mice, indicative of a Shank3-dependent and not compensatory mechanism for this structural alteration. We analyzed transcriptional differences by RNA-sequencing of muscle tissue of neonatal <i>Shank3Δ11(-/-)</i> mice and compared those to <i>Shank3(+/+)</i> controls. We found significant differences in gene expression of ion channels crucial for muscle contraction and for molecules involved in calcium ion regulation. In addition, calcium storage- [i.e., Calsequestrin (CSQ)], calcium secretion- and calcium-related signaling-proteins were found to be affected. By immunostainings and Western blot analyses we could confirm these findings both in <i>Shank3Δ11(-/-)</i> mice and PMS patient muscle tissue. Moreover, alterations could be induced <i>in vitro</i> by the selective downregulation of Shank3 in C2C12 myotubes. Our results emphasize that SHANK3 levels directly or indirectly regulate calcium homeostasis in a cell autonomous manner that might contribute to muscular hypotonia especially seen in the newborn.},

Interpretation of findings is further hampered by small samples and a focus on a limited number of networks, with networks underlying sensory processing being largely underexamined. We aimed to comprehensively characterize ASD-related alterations within and between 20 well-characterized resting-state networks using baseline data from the EU-AIMS (European Autism Interventions-A Multicentre Study for Developing New Medications) Longitudinal European Autism Project.<h4>Methods</h4>Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data was available for 265 individuals with ASD (7.5-30.3 years; 73.2% male) and 218 typically developing individuals (6.9-29.8 years; 64.2% male), all with IQ > 70. We compared functional connectivity within 20 networks-obtained using independent component analysis-between the ASD and typically developing groups, and related functional connectivity within these networks to continuous (overall) autism trait severity scores derived from the Social Responsiveness Scale Second Edition across all participants. Furthermore, we investigated case-control differences and autism trait-related alterations in between-network connectivity.<h4>Results</h4>Higher autism traits were associated with increased connectivity within salience, medial motor, and orbitofrontal networks. However, we did not replicate previously reported case-control differences within these networks. The between-network analysis did reveal case-control differences showing on average 1) decreased connectivity of the visual association network with somatosensory, medial, and lateral motor networks, and 2) increased connectivity of the cerebellum with these sensory and motor networks in ASD compared with typically developing subjects.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We demonstrate ASD-related alterations in within- and between-network connectivity. The between-network alterations broadly affect connectivity between cerebellum, visual, and sensory-motor networks, potentially underlying impairments in multisensory and visual-motor integration frequently observed in ASD.},

	Abstract = {There is increasing interest in the use of cannabis and its major non-intoxicating component cannabidiol (CBD) as a treatment for mental health and neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, before launching large-scale clinical trials, a better understanding of the effects of CBD on brain would be desirable. Preclinical evidence suggests that one aspect of the polypharmacy of CBD is that it modulates brain excitatory glutamate and inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels, including in brain regions linked to ASD, such as the basal ganglia (BG) and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC). However, differences in glutamate and GABA pathways in ASD mean that the response to CBD in people with and without ASD may be not be the same. To test whether CBD 'shifts' glutamate and GABA levels; and to examine potential differences in this response in ASD, we used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure glutamate (Glx = glutamate + glutamine) and GABA+ (GABA + macromolecules) levels in 34 healthy men (17 neurotypicals, 17 ASD). Data acquisition commenced 2 h (peak plasma levels) after a single oral dose of 600 mg CBD or placebo. Test sessions were at least 13 days apart. Across groups, CBD increased subcortical, but decreased cortical, Glx. Across regions, CBD increased GABA+ in controls, but decreased GABA+ in ASD; the group difference in change in GABA + in the DMPFC was significant. Thus, CBD modulates glutamate-GABA systems, but prefrontal-GABA systems respond differently in ASD. Our results do not speak to the efficacy of CBD. Future studies should examine the effects of chronic administration on brain and behaviour, and whether acute brain changes predict longer-term response.},

Our study examines the functional connectivity integration between primary modal sensory regions and heteromodal processing cortex in ASD, and whether abnormalities in network integration relate to clinical severity.<h4>Method</h4>We studied a sample of 55 high-functioning ASD and 64 healthy control (HC) male children and adolescents (total n = 119, age range 7-18 years). Stepwise functional connectivity analysis (SFC) was applied to resting state functional magnetic resonance images (rsfMRI) to characterize the connectivity paths that link primary sensory cortices to higher-order brain cognitive functional circuits and to relate alterations in functional connectivity integration with three clinical scales: Social Communication Questionnaire, Social Responsiveness Scale, and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales.<h4>Results</h4>HC displayed typical functional connectivity transitions from primary sensory systems to association areas, but the ASD group showed altered patterns of multimodal sensory integration to heteromodal systems. Specifically, compared to the HC group, the ASD group showed the following: (1) hyperconnectivity in the visual cortex at initial link step distances; (2) hyperconnectivity between sensory unimodal regions and regions of the default mode network; and (3) hypoconnectivity between sensory unimodal regions and areas of the fronto-parietal and attentional networks. These patterns of hyper- and hypoconnectivity were associated with increased clinical severity in ASD.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Networkwise reorganization in high-functioning ASD individuals affects strategic regions of unimodal-to-heteromodal cortical integration predicting clinical severity. In addition, SFC analysis appears to be a promising approach for studying the neural pathophysiology of multisensory integration deficits in ASD.},

The present study used an anonymous, online survey to determine how common certain physical health conditions are among autistic adults, compared with non-autistic adults. We found autistic adults are more likely to develop heart conditions, lung conditions, and diabetes than non-autistic adults. Autistic females may be at higher risk of developing certain conditions (including respiratory conditions, asthma, and prediabetes) than autistic males. Finally, autistic individuals have increased health risks even when considering lifestyle factors (such as smoking, alcohol, and body mass index). This is still a relatively small study, and future research needs to confirm these findings and identify why these risks exist.},

	Abstract = {Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental condition with substantial phenotypic, biological, and etiologic heterogeneity. It remains a challenge to identify biomarkers to stratify autism into replicable cognitive or biological subtypes. Here, we aim to introduce a novel methodological framework for parsing neuroanatomical subtypes within a large cohort of individuals with autism. We used cortical thickness (CT) in a large and well-characterized sample of 316 participants with autism (88 female, age mean: 17.2 ± 5.7) and 206 with neurotypical development (79 female, age mean: 17.5 ± 6.1) aged 6-31 years across six sites from the EU-AIMS multi-center Longitudinal European Autism Project. Five biologically based putative subtypes were derived using normative modeling of CT and spectral clustering. Three of these clusters showed relatively widespread decreased CT and two showed relatively increased CT. These subtypes showed morphometric differences from one another, providing a potential explanation for inconsistent case-control findings in autism, and loaded differentially and more strongly onto symptoms and polygenic risk, indicating a dilution of clinical effects across heterogeneous cohorts. Our results provide an important step towards parsing the heterogeneous neurobiology of autism.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Objective</h4>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are common neurodevelopmental disorders that frequently co-occur. The authors sought to directly compare these disorders using structural brain imaging data from ENIGMA consortium data.<h4>Methods</h4>Structural T<sub>1</sub>-weighted whole-brain MRI data from healthy control subjects (N=5,827) and from patients with ADHD (N=2,271), ASD (N=1,777), and OCD (N=2,323) from 151 cohorts worldwide were analyzed using standardized processing protocols. The authors examined subcortical volume, cortical thickness, and cortical surface area differences within a mega-analytical framework, pooling measures extracted from each cohort. Analyses were performed separately for children, adolescents, and adults, using linear mixed-effects models adjusting for age, sex, and site (and intracranial volume for subcortical and surface area measures).<h4>Results</h4>No shared differences were found among all three disorders, and shared differences between any two disorders did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. Children with ADHD compared with those with OCD had smaller hippocampal volumes, possibly influenced by IQ. Children and adolescents with ADHD also had smaller intracranial volume than control subjects and those with OCD or ASD. Adults with ASD showed thicker frontal cortices compared with adult control subjects and other clinical groups. No OCD-specific differences were observed across different age groups and surface area differences among all disorders in childhood and adulthood.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The study findings suggest robust but subtle differences across different age groups among ADHD, ASD, and OCD. ADHD-specific intracranial volume and hippocampal differences in children and adolescents, and ASD-specific cortical thickness differences in the frontal cortex in adults, support previous work emphasizing structural brain differences in these disorders.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>A significant proportion of variation in likelihood of neurodevelopmental conditions (NDCs) has been attributed to nonshared environmental (NSE) factors, although it remains unclear which NSE factors pose specific risks for certain NDCs.<h4>Methods</h4>A monozygotic co-twin design was applied in a sample of 224 twins (mean age = 17.70 years, SD = 6.28) controlling for confounders such as genes and shared environment. Generalized estimating equation models were fitted, using perinatal and postnatal indications of NSEs as exposure, operationalized both as separate risk factors and as cumulative risk loads. Categorical and dimensional operationalizations of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), intellectual disability and other NDCs were used as outcomes.<h4>Results</h4>Birth weight discordance was associated with dimensional autism and ADHD for the smaller twin, and medication during infancy was associated with dimensional autism. Among postnatal factors scarlet fever during early childhood was associated with lower IQ. Especially autism was associated with a greater cumulative perinatal or postnatal risk load.<h4>Limitations</h4>When exploring the associations between each condition and specific NSEs the risk of being statistically underpowered increases. Hence, we limit the reported findings on specific indicators of NSEs to trait levels and present descriptive data for categorical NDCs.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The findings support previous research by indicating an association between exposure to perinatal and postnatal risks and subsequent NDCs within twin pairs and suggest that autism may be especially linked to accumulative early environmental risks. The findings are potentially important for developmental outcomes prognoses and may inform targeted prevention and early interventions.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>While there are known risk factors for suicidality in autistic adults, these are often unconnected from theoretical frameworks that might explain why risk is elevated and guide clinical interventions. The present study investigated the relevance of constructs from the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (ITS), including perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness and acquired capability for suicide, and explored mechanisms through which certain risk factors (relationship status, age at diagnosis) might elevate suicide risk.<h4>Methods</h4>Autistic adults (n = 314) completed an online study including measures of depression, anxiety and constructs from the ITS. Linear and multinomial regression analysis disentangled contributions of ITS variables from effects of depression and anxiety for past-year suicide ideation, past-year and lifetime suicide attempts. Mediation analyses examined associations between risk factors and these suicide outcomes via mechanisms proposed by the ITS.<h4>Results</h4>Past-year suicide ideation was associated with burdensomeness, mental rehearsal of suicide plans (a facet of acquired capability), and depression. Greater feelings of burdensomeness, and reduced fear of death, marked out participants who had attempted suicide in comparison to those who had experienced suicide ideation in the past year. Relationship status was indirectly associated with past-year suicide ideation via the mediators of depression and burdensomeness, and was associated with past-year attempts via its effect on ideation. Age at diagnosis was unrelated to any variables.<h4>Limitations</h4>Cross-sectional research is insensitive to causality and temporal dynamics, which is likely why interaction hypotheses from the ITS were unsupported. Normative measures may be invalid in autistic samples. There was no control group. The autistic sample was unrepresentative of the whole population, particularly autistic people with intellectual disabilities, ethnic/racial minorities, and gender minorities.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Perceived burdensomeness and acquired capability appear potentially important to suicide in autistic people, and may mediate the effects of some risk factors. Future research should explore the temporal dynamics of suicide trajectories in longitudinal, prospective designs.},

Efforts to unravel sex differences in the brain organization of autism have, however, been challenged by the limited availability of female data.<h4>Methods</h4>We addressed this gap by using a large sample of males and females with autism and neurotypical (NT) control individuals (ABIDE; Autism: 362 males, 82 females; NT: 409 males, 166 females; 7-18 years). Discovery analyses examined main effects of diagnosis, sex and their interaction across five resting-state fMRI (R-fMRI) metrics (voxel-level Z > 3.1, cluster-level P < 0.01, gaussian random field corrected). Secondary analyses assessed the robustness of the results to different pre-processing approaches and their replicability in two independent samples: the EU-AIMS Longitudinal European Autism Project (LEAP) and the Gender Explorations of Neurogenetics and Development to Advance Autism Research.<h4>Results</h4>Discovery analyses in ABIDE revealed significant main effects of diagnosis and sex across the intrinsic functional connectivity of the posterior cingulate cortex, regional homogeneity and voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) in several cortical regions, largely converging in the default network midline. Sex-by-diagnosis interactions were confined to the dorsolateral occipital cortex, with reduced VMHC in females with autism. All findings were robust to different pre-processing steps. Replicability in independent samples varied by R-fMRI measures and effects with the targeted sex-by-diagnosis interaction being replicated in the larger of the two replication samples-EU-AIMS LEAP.<h4>Limitations</h4>Given the lack of a priori harmonization among the discovery and replication datasets available to date, sample-related variation remained and may have affected replicability.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Atypical cross-hemispheric interactions are neurobiologically relevant to autism. They likely result from the combination of sex-dependent and sex-independent factors with a differential effect across functional cortical networks. Systematic assessments of the factors contributing to replicability are needed and necessitate coordinated large-scale data collection across studies.},

	Abstract = {Altered structural brain asymmetry in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been reported. However, findings have been inconsistent, likely due to limited sample sizes. Here we investigated 1,774 individuals with ASD and 1,809 controls, from 54 independent data sets of the ENIGMA consortium. ASD was significantly associated with alterations of cortical thickness asymmetry in mostly medial frontal, orbitofrontal, cingulate and inferior temporal areas, and also with asymmetry of orbitofrontal surface area. These differences generally involved reduced asymmetry in individuals with ASD compared to controls. Furthermore, putamen volume asymmetry was significantly increased in ASD. The largest case-control effect size was Cohen's d = -0.13, for asymmetry of superior frontal cortical thickness. Most effects did not depend on age, sex, IQ, severity or medication use. Altered lateralized neurodevelopment may therefore be a feature of ASD, affecting widespread brain regions with diverse functions. Large-scale analysis was necessary to quantify subtle alterations of brain structural asymmetry in ASD.},

Medical comorbidities are common in ASD and include functional gastrointestinal disorders (fGID), which are reported in 30-70% of patients. In this research study, we aimed to systematically assess the prevalence of gastrointestinal problems in ASD and describe their clinical correlates. <b>Methods:</b> In this retrospective study, we reviewed the medical records of all patients admitted to the Comprehensive Medical Program for ASD (AMITEA) at Gregorio Marañón University General Hospital from January 2012 to December 2015. All patients fulfilled the clinical criteria for ASD (DSM-IV-TR). In addition to fGID, epidemiological and clinical variables were collected at intake. Clinical and demographic features were compared among subjects with and without comorbid gastrointestinal problems. <b>Results:</b> The analyses included all patients with documented information about presence/absence of fGID (<i>n</i> = 845; 95% of patients). Ages ranged from 1 to 53 years (mean = 10.52; SD = 8.92; 80.4% males). At least one fGID was present in 30.5% of patients, constipation being the most prevalent (47.4% of fGID patients); fGID were significantly associated with intellectual disability (ID) (<i>p</i> = 0.017), sleep disorders (<i>p</i> = 0.012), and prescription of psychopharmacological treatment (<i>p</i> = 0.019). <b>Conclusions:</b> Almost one-third of ASD patients in our sample had at least one fGID. The presence of fGID was associated with ID, sleep problems and with behavioral problems (as measured by the prescription of psychotropic drugs). This subsample of ASD patients with fGID deserves particular attention in future research projects, focusing on specific phenotypic characteristics and overlapping biological markers that may underlie both pathologies.},

These neuroimaging features have been proposed as intermediate phenotypes on the gradient from genomic variation to behavioral symptoms. Hence, examining what these proxy markers represent, i.e., disentangling their associated molecular and genomic underpinnings, could provide crucial insights into the etiology and pathophysiology of autism. In line with this, an increasing number of studies are exploring the association between neuroanatomical, cellular/molecular, and (epi)genetic variation in autism, both indirectly and directly <i>in vivo</i> and across age. In this review, we aim to summarize the existing literature in autism (and neurotypicals) to chart a putative pathway from (i) imaging-derived neuroanatomical cortical phenotypes to (ii) underlying (neuropathological) biological processes, and (iii) associated genomic variation.},

It is unclear whether self-report suicide scales that have been designed for non-autistic people accurately measure suicide risk constructs in autistic people. Therefore, this study explored, for the first time, whether the measurement properties of the self-report scales of the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide are equivalent in autistic and non-autistic adults. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> In this study, responses from 342 autistic and 353 non-autistic people on the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire-10 (INQ-10) and Acquired Capability for Suicide Scale-Fearlessness about Death (ACSS-FAD) were compared by using measurement invariance analysis. Data were gathered through an online cross-sectional survey of the self-report measures. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Results suggest that measurement properties of the INQ-10 were different in autistic people. Autistic characteristics, such as different theory of mind and preference for concrete language, may have led the scale items to load differently on the factors in the autistic group than in the non-autistic group. The measurement properties of the ACSS-FAD were invariant between autistic and non-autistic people. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Scores on the INQ-10 cannot be meaningfully compared between autistic and non-autistic people due to different measurement properties. Future research could explore how autistic people experience the concepts of burdensomeness and belonging, to consider how measures could accurately capture this. This would allow researchers to explore the role of these constructs in the development of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in autistic people. Clinicians should be aware that suicide risk factors may present differently in autistic people. Scores on the ACSS-FAD can be meaningfully compared, but the negatively worded scale items may pose similar response difficulties to autistic and non-autistic people.},

We analyzed Shank3Δ11(-/-) mice and organoids from PMDS individuals to study effects on myelin. SHANK3 was found to be expressed in oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells, and MRI analysis of Shank3Δ11(-/-) mice revealed a reduced volume of the corpus callosum as seen in PMDS patients. Myelin proteins including myelin basic protein showed significant temporal and regional differences with lower levels in the CNS but increased amounts in the PNS of Shank3Δ11(-/-) animals. Node, as well as paranode, lengths were increased and ultrastructural analysis revealed region-specific alterations of the myelin sheaths. In PMDS hiPSC-derived cerebral organoids we observed an altered number and delayed maturation of myelinating cells. These findings provide evidence that, in addition to a synaptic deregulation, impairment of myelin might profoundly contribute to the clinical manifestation of SHANK3 deficiency.},

	Abstract = {Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are caused by a combination of genetic predisposition and nongenetic factors. Among the nongenetic factors, maternal immune system activation and zinc deficiency have been proposed. Intriguingly, as a genetic factor, copy-number variations in S100B, a pro-inflammatory damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), have been associated with ASD, and increased serum S100B has been found in ASD. Interestingly, it has been shown that increased S100B levels affect zinc homeostasis in vitro. Thus, here, we investigated the influence of increased S100B levels in vitro and in vivo during pregnancy in mice regarding zinc availability, the zinc-sensitive SHANK protein networks associated with ASD, and behavioral outcomes. We observed that S100B affects the synaptic SHANK2 and SHANK3 levels in a zinc-dependent manner, especially early in neuronal development. Animals exposed to high S100B levels in utero similarly show reduced levels of free zinc and SHANK2 in the brain. On the behavioral level, these mice display hyperactivity, increased stereotypic and abnormal social behaviors, and cognitive impairment. Pro-inflammatory factors and zinc-signaling alterations converge on the synaptic level revealing a common pathomechanism that may mechanistically explain a large share of ASD cases.},

This report maps autism and SEN policies, and tension of international legislation in Malta, Cyprus, Luxembourg and Slovenia.<h4>Methods</h4>A policy path analysis was performed using a scoping review as fundamental methodological framework.<h4>Results</h4>Education for children with SEN developed from limited education towards segregation, and further to integration, and inclusion in mainstream education. International policy has greatly influenced the education systems under study. The rights to education and to have SEN addressed have been adopted in all countries. Inclusion is seen to be gradually incorporated by Malta, Cyprus and Luxembourg-closely following values of international documents through concise SEN policies. Slovenia's education system remains segregated, indicating potential tension.<h4>Conclusions</h4>It appears that mainstream schools offer SEN services until no longer feasible for the child in the majority of investigated countries. Inclusion has become a guiding principle for most education systems under study. Finally, small states either commit to the implementation of inclusion or delay it and attempt to improve the education system for children with SEN in different ways.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Autism spectrum condition (ASC) is accompanied by developmental differences in brain anatomy and connectivity. White matter differences in ASC have been widely studied with diffusion imaging but results are heterogeneous and vary across the age range of study participants and varying methodological approaches. To characterize the neurodevelopmental trajectory of white matter maturation, it is necessary to examine a broad age range of individuals on the autism spectrum and typically developing controls, and investigate age × group interactions.<h4>Methods</h4>Here, we employed a spatially unbiased tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) approach to examine age-related differences in white matter connectivity in a sample of 41 individuals with ASC, and 41 matched controls between 7-17 years of age.<h4>Results</h4>We found significant age-related differences between the ASC and control group in widespread brain regions. This included age-related differences in the uncinate fasciculus, corticospinal tract, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, anterior thalamic radiation, superior longitudinal fasciculus and forceps major. Measures of fractional anisotropy (FA) were significantly positively associated with age in both groups. However, this relationship was significantly stronger in the ASC group relative to controls. Measures of radial diffusivity (RD) were significantly negatively associated with age in both groups, but this relationship was significantly stronger in the ASC group relative to controls.<h4>Limitations</h4>The generalisability of our findings is limited by the restriction of the sample to right-handed males with an IQ > 70. Furthermore, a longitudinal design would be required to fully investigate maturational processes across this age group.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Taken together, our findings suggest that autistic males have an altered trajectory of white matter maturation relative to controls. Future longitudinal analyses are required to further characterize the extent and time course of these differences.},

	Abstract = {Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) encompass a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders resulting from the complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Thanks to the chromosome microarray analysis (CMA) in clinical practice, the accurate identification and characterization of submicroscopic deletions/duplications (copy number variants, CNVs) associated with ASD was made possible. However, the widely acknowledged excess of males on the autism spectrum reflects on a paucity of CMA studies specifically focused on females with ASD (f-ASD). In this framework, we aim to evaluate the frequency of causative CNVs in a single-center cohort of idiopathic f-ASD. Among the 90 f-ASD analyzed, we found 20 patients with one or two potentially pathogenic CNVs, including those previously associated with ASD (located at 16<i>p</i>13.2 16<i>p</i>11.2, 15<i>q</i>11.2, and 22<i>q</i>11.21 regions). An exploratory genotype/phenotype analysis revealed that the f-ASD with causative CNVs had statistically significantly lower restrictive and repetitive behaviors than those without CNVs or with non-causative CNVs. Future work should focus on further understanding of f-ASD genetic underpinnings, taking advantage of next-generation sequencing technologies, with the ultimate goal of contributing to precision medicine in ASD.},

	Abstract = {Neuroimaging has been extensively used to study brain structure and function in individuals with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) over the past decades. Two of the main shortcomings of the neuroimaging literature of these disorders are the small sample sizes employed and the heterogeneity of methods used. In 2013 and 2014, the ENIGMA-ADHD and ENIGMA-ASD working groups were respectively, founded with a common goal to address these limitations. Here, we provide a narrative review of the thus far completed and still ongoing projects of these working groups. Due to an implicitly hierarchical psychiatric diagnostic classification system, the fields of ADHD and ASD have developed largely in isolation, despite the considerable overlap in the occurrence of the disorders. The collaboration between the ENIGMA-ADHD and -ASD working groups seeks to bring the neuroimaging efforts of the two disorders closer together. The outcomes of case-control studies of subcortical and cortical structures showed that subcortical volumes are similarly affected in ASD and ADHD, albeit with small effect sizes. Cortical analyses identified unique differences in each disorder, but also considerable overlap between the two, specifically in cortical thickness. Ongoing work is examining alternative research questions, such as brain laterality, prediction of case-control status, and anatomical heterogeneity. In brief, great strides have been made toward fulfilling the aims of the ENIGMA collaborations, while new ideas and follow-up analyses continue that include more imaging modalities (diffusion MRI and resting-state functional MRI), collaborations with other large databases, and samples with dual diagnoses.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with deficits in executive functioning (EF), and these have been suggested to contribute to core as well as co-occurring psychiatric symptoms. The biological basis of these deficits is unknown but may include the serotonergic system, which is involved both in regulating EF in neurotypical populations and in the pathophysiology of ASD. We previously demonstrated that reducing serotonin by acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) shifts differences in brain function during performance of EF tasks towards control levels. However, ATD cannot be easily used in the clinic, and we therefore need to adopt alternative approaches to challenge the serotonin system. Hence, we investigated the role of the serotonergic modulator tianeptine on EF networks in ASD.<h4>Method</h4>We conducted a pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging study, using a randomized double-blind crossover design, to compare the effect of an acute dosage of 12.5 mg tianeptine and placebo on brain activation during two EF tasks (of response inhibition and sustained attention) in 38 adult males: 19 with ASD and 19 matched controls.<h4>Results</h4>Under placebo, compared to controls, individuals with ASD had atypical brain activation in response inhibition regions including the inferior frontal cortex, premotor regions and cerebellum. During sustained attention, individuals with ASD had decreased brain activation in the right middle temporal cortex, right cuneus and left precuneus. Most of the case-control differences in brain function observed under placebo conditions were abolished by tianeptine administration. Also, within ASD individuals, brain functional differences were shifted significantly towards control levels during response inhibition in the inferior frontal and premotor cortices.<h4>Limitations</h4>We conducted a pilot study using a single dose of tianeptine, and therefore, we cannot comment on long-term outcome.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings provide the first evidence that tianeptine can shift atypical brain activation during EF in adults with ASD towards control levels. Future studies should investigate whether this shift in the biology of ASD is maintained after prolonged treatment with tianeptine and whether it improves clinical symptoms.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Autism screening is recommended at 18- and 24-month pediatric well visits. The Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers-Revised (M-CHAT-R) authors recommend a follow-up interview (M-CHAT-R/F) when positive. M-CHAT-R/F may be less accurate for 18-month-olds than 24-month-olds and accuracy for identification prior to two years is not known in samples that include children screening negative. Since autism symptoms may emerge gradually, ordinally scoring items based on the full range of response options, such as in the 10-item version of the Quantitative Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (Q-CHAT-10), might better capture autism signs than the dichotomous (i.e., yes/no) items in M-CHAT-R or the pass/fail scoring of Q-CHAT-10 items. The aims of this study were to determine and compare the accuracy of the M-CHAT-R/F and the Q-CHAT-10 and to describe the accuracy of the ordinally scored Q-CHAT-10 (Q-CHAT-10-O) for predicting autism in a sample of children who were screened at 18 months.<h4>Methods</h4>This is a community pediatrics validation study with screen positive (n = 167) and age- and practice-matched screen negative children (n = 241) recruited for diagnostic evaluations completed prior to 2 years old. Clinical diagnosis of autism was based on results of in-person diagnostic autism evaluations by research reliable testers blind to screening results and using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Second Edition (ADOS-2) Toddler Module and Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) per standard guidelines.<h4>Results</h4>While the M-CHAT-R/F had higher specificity and PPV compared to M-CHAT-R, Q-CHAT-10-O showed higher sensitivity than M-CHAT-R/F and Q-CHAT-10.<h4>Limitations</h4>Many parents declined participation and the sample is over-represented by higher educated parents. Results cannot be extended to older ages.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Limitations of the currently recommended two-stage M-CHAT-R/F at the 18-month visit include low sensitivity with minimal balancing benefit of improved PPV from the follow-up interview. Ordinal, rather than dichotomous, scoring of autism screening items appears to be beneficial at this age. The Q-CHAT-10-O with ordinal scoring shows advantages to M-CHAT-R/F with half the number of items, no requirement for a follow-up interview, and improved sensitivity. Yet, Q-CHAT-10-O sensitivity is less than M-CHAT-R (without follow-up) and specificity is less than the two-stage procedure. Such limitations are consistent with recognition that screening needs to recur beyond this age.},

	Abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder is a construct used to describe individuals with a specific combination of impairments in social communication and repetitive behaviours, highly restricted interests and/or sensory behaviours beginning early in life. The worldwide prevalence of autism is just under 1%, but estimates are higher in high-income countries. Although gross brain pathology is not characteristic of autism, subtle anatomical and functional differences have been observed in post-mortem, neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies. Initially, it was hoped that accurate measurement of behavioural phenotypes would lead to specific genetic subtypes, but genetic findings have mainly applied to heterogeneous groups that are not specific to autism. Psychosocial interventions in children can improve specific behaviours, such as joint attention, language and social engagement, that may affect further development and could reduce symptom severity. However, further research is necessary to identify the long-term needs of people with autism, and treatments and the mechanisms behind them that could result in improved independence and quality of life over time. Families are often the major source of support for people with autism throughout much of life and need to be considered, along with the perspectives of autistic individuals, in both research and practice.},

	Abstract = {Over the past decade, biomarker discovery has become a key goal in psychiatry to aid in the more reliable diagnosis and prognosis of heterogeneous psychiatric conditions and the development of tailored therapies. Nevertheless, the prevailing statistical approach is still the mean group comparison between "cases" and "controls," which tends to ignore within-group variability. In this educational article, we used empirical data simulations to investigate how effect size, sample size, and the shape of distributions impact the interpretation of mean group differences for biomarker discovery. We then applied these statistical criteria to evaluate biomarker discovery in one area of psychiatric research-autism research. Across the most influential areas of autism research, effect size estimates ranged from small (d = 0.21, anatomical structure) to medium (d = 0.36 electrophysiology, d = 0.5, eye-tracking) to large (d = 1.1 theory of mind). We show that in normal distributions, this translates to approximately 45% to 63% of cases performing within 1 standard deviation (SD) of the typical range, i.e., they do not have a deficit/atypicality in a statistical sense. For a measure to have diagnostic utility as defined by 80% sensitivity and 80% specificity, Cohen's d of 1.66 is required, with still 40% of cases falling within 1 SD. However, in both normal and nonnormal distributions, 1 (skewness) or 2 (platykurtic, bimodal) biologically plausible subgroups may exist despite small or even nonsignificant mean group differences. This conclusion drastically contrasts the way mean group differences are frequently reported. Over 95% of studies omitted the "on average" when summarising their findings in their abstracts ("autistic people have deficits in X"), which can be misleading as it implies that the group-level difference applies to all individuals in that group. We outline practical approaches and steps for researchers to explore mean group comparisons for the discovery of stratification biomarkers.},

Many rare copy number variants are associated with neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions (ND-CNV), including schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders, and may contribute to the observed variability in cognitive ability. Here, we reviewed studies of intelligence quotient or cognitive function in ND-CNV carriers, from both general population and clinical cohorts, to understand the cognitive impact of ND-CNV in both contexts and identify potential genotype-specific cognitive phenotypes. We reviewed aggregate studies of sets ND-CNV broadly linked to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions, and genotype-first studies of a subset of 12 ND-CNV robustly associated with schizophrenia and autism. Cognitive impacts were observed across ND-CNV in both general population and clinical cohorts, with reports of phenotypic heterogeneity. Evidence for ND-CNV-specific impacts were limited by a small number of studies and samples sizes. A comprehensive understanding of the cognitive impact of ND-CNVs would be clinically informative and could identify potential educational needs for ND-CNV carriers. This could improve genetic counselling for families impacted by ND-CNV, and clinical outcomes for those with complex needs.},

	Abstract = {The core diagnostic criteria for autism comprise two symptom domains - social and communication difficulties, and unusually repetitive and restricted behaviour, interests and activities. There is some evidence to suggest that these two domains are dissociable, though this hypothesis has not yet been tested using molecular genetics. We test this using a genome-wide association study (<i>N</i> = 51,564) of a non-social trait related to autism, systemising, defined as the drive to analyse and build systems. We demonstrate that systemising is heritable and genetically correlated with autism. In contrast, we do not identify significant genetic correlations between social autistic traits and systemising. Supporting this, polygenic scores for systemising are significantly and positively associated with restricted and repetitive behaviour but not with social difficulties in autistic individuals. These findings strongly suggest that the two core domains of autism are genetically dissociable, and point at how to fractionate the genetics of autism.},

	Abstract = {Impairments in social interaction and communication, in combination with restricted, repetitive behaviors and interests, define the neurodevelopmental diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The biological underpinnings of ASD are not well known, but the hypothesis of serotonin (5-HT) involvement in the neurodevelopment of ASD is one of the longest standing. Reuptake through the 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) is the main pathway decreasing extracellular 5-HT in the brain and a marker for the 5-HT system, but in vivo investigations of the 5-HTT and the 5-HT system in ASD are scarce and so far inconclusive. To quantify possible alterations in the 5-HT system in ASD, we used positron emission tomography and the radioligand [<sup>11</sup>C]MADAM to measure 5-HTT availability in the brain of 15 adults with ASD and 15 controls. Moreover, we examined correlations between regional 5-HTT availability and behavioral phenotype assessments regarding ASD core symptoms. In the ASD group, we found significantly lower 5-HTT availability in total gray matter, brainstem, and 9 of 18 examined subregions of gray matter. In addition, several correlations between regional 5-HTT availability and social cognitive test performance were found. The results confirm the hypothesis that 5-HTT availability is lower in the brain of adult individuals with ASD, and are consistent with the theory of 5-HT involvement in ASD neurodevelopment. The findings endorse the central role of 5-HT in the physiology of ASD, and confirm the need for a continued investigation of the 5-HT system in order to disentangle the biology of ASD.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Importance</h4>Low birth weight is associated with an increased likelihood of neurodivergence and neurodevelopmental conditions (NDCs) such as autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and intellectual disability. However, it is unclear whether birth weight contributes independently to NDCs or whether the association is predominantly driven by genetic predisposition.<h4>Objective</h4>To estimate the associations between birth weight and dimensional (trait) and categorical (diagnoses) NDC outcomes, while adjusting for genetic risks.<h4>Design, setting, and participants</h4>A co-twin design was applied to this case-control study conducted in Sweden. Diagnostic assessments were conducted between August 2011 and March 2022, within the Roots of Autism and ADHD Twin Study in Sweden (RATSS) during a 2.5-day participant visit to the clinic. The RATSS sample comprised phenotyped monozygotic and dizygotic twins enriched for NDCs. Data analysis was conducted in November 2022.<h4>Exposure</h4>Birth weight.<h4>Main outcomes and measures</h4>Categorical and dimensional operationalizations of autism, ADHD, and intellectual disability were assessed. Generalized estimating equation models were fitted across and within twin pairs.<h4>Results</h4>The study sample included 393 twins: 230 were monozygotic and 159 were dizygotic (zygosity was unknown for 4). Their median age was 15 (range, 8-37) years. There were 185 female participants (47.1%) and 208 male participants (52.9%). Across twin pairs, higher birth weight was associated with fewer autistic traits (unstandardized β [B], -5.51 [95% CI, -10.09 to -0.94]) and lower odds of autism diagnosis (OR, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.45 to 0.88]) and intellectual disability (OR, 0.42 [95% CI, 0.19 to 0.92]). Within pairs, the association between birth weight and dimensional autism (B, -17.35 [95% CI, -28.66 to -6.04]) and categorical autism (OR, 0.02 [95% CI, 0.001 to 0.42]) remained among monozygotic pairs but not dizygotic pairs. In addition, higher birth weight was associated with lower odds of ADHD diagnosis (OR, 0.003 [95% CI, 0 to 0.70]), fewer ADHD traits (B, -0.25 [95% CI, -0.39 to -0.11]), and higher IQ ratings (B, 7.43 [95% CI, 1.05 to 13.82]) among monozygotic twins.<h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4>The findings of this co-twin study suggest an association between low birth weight and NDCs, but they also acknowledge the importance of genetics because the associations observed were only statically significant among monozygotic twins. It is of pivotal importance to facilitate early identification of factors contributing to fetal growth restriction to minimize detrimental outcomes.},

	Abstract = {Phelan McDermid syndrome (PMcD) is a neurogenetic disease associated with haploinsufficiency of the <i>SHANK3</i> gene due to a spectrum of anomalies in the terminal region of the long arm of chromosome 22. <i>SHANK3</i> is the abbreviation for SH3 domain and ankyrin repeat-containing protein, a gene that encodes for proteins of the postsynaptic density (PSD) of excitatory synapses. This PSD is relevant for the induction and plasticity of spine and synapse formation as a basis for learning processes and long-term potentiation. Individuals with PMcD present with intellectual disability, muscular hypotonia, and severely delayed or absent speech. Further neuropsychiatric manifestations cover symptoms of the autism spectrum, epilepsy, bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, and regression. Regression is one of the most feared syndromes by relatives of PMcD patients. Current scientific evidence indicates that the onset of regression is variable and affects language, motor skills, activities of daily living and cognition. In the case of regression, patients normally undergo further diagnostics to exclude treatable reasons such as complex-focal seizures or psychiatric comorbidities. Here, we report, for the first time, the case of a young female who developed progressive symptoms of regression and a dystonic-spastic hemiparesis that could be traced back to a comorbid multiple sclerosis and that improved after treatment with methylprednisolone.},

	Abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition of heterogeneous etiology. While it is widely recognized that genetic and environmental factors and their interactions contribute to autism phenotypes, their precise causal mechanisms remain poorly understood. This article reviews our current understanding of environmental risk factors of ASD and their presumed adverse physiological mechanisms. It comprehensively maps the significance of parental age, teratogenic compounds, perinatal risks, medication, smoking and alcohol use, nutrition, vaccination, toxic exposures, as well as the role of extreme psychosocial factors. Further, we consider the role of potential protective factors such as folate and fatty acid intake. Evidence indicates an increased offspring vulnerability to ASD through advanced maternal and paternal age, valproate intake, toxic chemical exposure, maternal diabetes, enhanced steroidogenic activity, immune activation, and possibly altered zinc-copper cycles and treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Epidemiological studies demonstrate no evidence for vaccination posing an autism risk. It is concluded that future research needs to consider categorical autism, broader autism phenotypes, as well as autistic traits, and examine more homogenous autism variants by subgroup stratification. Our understanding of autism etiology could be advanced by research aimed at disentangling the causal and non-causal environmental effects, both founding and moderating, and gene-environment interplay using twin studies, longitudinal and experimental designs. The specificity of many environmental risks for ASD remains unknown and control of multiple confounders has been limited. Further understanding of the critical windows of neurodevelopmental vulnerability and investigating the fit of multiple hit and cumulative risk models are likely promising approaches in enhancing the understanding of role of environmental factors in the etiology of ASD.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>From birth, infants orient preferentially to faces, and when looking at the face, they attend primarily to eyes and mouth. These areas convey different types of information, and earlier research suggests that genetic factors influence the preference for one or the other in young children.<h4>Methods</h4>In a sample of 535 5-month-old infant twins, we assessed eye (relative to mouth) preference in early infancy, i.e., before neural systems for social communication and language are fully developed. We investigated the contribution of genetic and environmental factors to the preference for looking at eyes, and the association with concurrent traits and follow-up measures.<h4>Results</h4>Eye preference was independent from all other concurrent traits measured, and had a moderate-to-high contribution from genetic influences (A = 0.57; 95% CI: 0.45, 0.66). Preference for eyes at 5 months was associated with higher parent ratings of receptive vocabulary at 14 months. No statistically significant association with later autistic traits was found. Preference for eyes was strikingly stable across different stimulus types (e.g., dynamic vs. still), suggesting that infants' preference at this age does not reflect sensitivity to low-level visual cues.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These results suggest that individual differences in infants' preferential looking to eyes versus mouth to a substantial degree reflect genetic variation. The findings provide new leads on both the perceptual basis and the developmental consequences of these attentional biases.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Importance</h4>The global prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been reported to be between 1% and 2% of the population, with little research in Black, Asian, and other racial/ethnic minority groups. Accurate estimates of ASD prevalence are vital to planning diagnostic, educational, health, and social care services and may detect possible access barriers to diagnostic pathways and services and inequalities based on social determinants of health.<h4>Objective</h4>To evaluate whether socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with ASD prevalence and the likelihood of accessing ASD services in racial/ethnic minority and disadvantaged groups in England.<h4>Design, setting, and participants</h4>This case-control prevalence cohort study used the Spring School Census 2017 from the Pupil Level Annual Schools Census of the National Pupil Database, which is a total population sample that includes all English children, adolescents, and young adults aged 2 to 21 years in state-funded education. Data were collected on January 17, 2017, and analyzed from August 2, 2018, to January 28, 2020.<h4>Exposures</h4>Age and sex were treated as a priori confounders while assessing correlates of ASD status according to (1) race/ethnicity, (2) social disadvantage, (3) first language spoken, (4) Education, Health and Care Plan or ASD Special Educational Needs and Disability support status, and (5) mediation analysis to assess how social disadvantage and language might affect ASD status.<h4>Main outcomes and measures</h4>Sex- and age-standardized ASD prevalence by race/ethnicity and 326 English local authority districts in pupils aged 5 to 19 years.<h4>Results</h4>The final population sample consisted of 7 047 238 pupils (50.99% male; mean [SD] age, 10.18 [3.47] years) and included 119 821 pupils with ASD, of whom 21 660 also had learning difficulties (18.08%). The standardized prevalence of ASD was 1.76% (95% CI, 1.75%-1.77%), with male pupils showing a prevalence of 2.81% (95% CI, 2.79%-2.83%) and female pupils a prevalence of 0.65% (95% CI, 0.64%-0.66%), for a male-to-female ratio (MFR) of 4.32:1. Standardized prevalence was highest in Black pupils (2.11% [95% CI, 2.06%-2.16%]; MFR, 4.68:1) and lowest in Roma/Irish Travelers (0.85% [95% CI, 0.67%-1.03%]; MFR, 2.84:1). Pupils with ASD were more likely to face social disadvantage (adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.59-1.63) and to speak English as an additional language (adjusted prevalence ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.63-0.65). The effect of race/ethnicity on ASD status was mediated mostly through social disadvantage, with Black pupils having the largest effect (standardized mediation coefficient, 0.018; P < .001) and 12.41% of indirect effects through this way.<h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4>These findings suggest that significant differences in ASD prevalence exist across racial/ethnic groups and geographic areas and local authority districts, indicating possible differential phenotypic prevalence or differences in detection or referral for racial/ethnic minority groups.},

	Abstract = {Since 2016, the project "Early Bird Diagnostic Protocol for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD)" funded by the Italian Ministry of Health has been operative at IRCCS Fondazione Stella Maris (FSM), Pisa (IT), with the main aim of developing early age-specific diagnostic protocols by longitudinally enrolling two different populations at risk for ASD: (i) toddlers with older siblings with ASD (FR) and (ii) toddlers referred by a child psychiatrist or pediatrician for suspected ASD (CR). On January 30, 2020, when the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), 136 patients (85 FR; 51 CR; 93 males; 43 females) had been enrolled in the project with 324 completed time points and 64 still missing. Considering both the huge psychological burden on families with toddlers at risk for ASD during the lockdown and the longitudinal studies reporting the positive "surveillance effect" in terms of a better outcome in at-risk toddlers, our priority has been to maintain regular contact and support to enrolled families. To do this, the research team, being authorized for smart-working research activities, has set up a detailed remote surveillance protocol (RSP). The RSP includes three online interviews and one online video registration of parent-child play. In the current community case study, the authors report the telehealth procedure and discuss possible future directions in developing remote assessment and new evaluation modalities for ecological parent-child play video recordings in at-risk populations. Hopefully, the surveillance protocol will further improve our ability to detect risk and activate early tailored intervention.},

	Abstract = {Autistic individuals experience significantly elevated rates of childhood trauma, self-harm and suicidal behaviour and ideation (SSBI). Is this purely the result of negative environmental experiences, or does this interact with genetic predisposition? In this study we investigated if a genetic predisposition for autism is associated with childhood trauma using polygenic scores (PGS) and genetic correlations in the UK Biobank (105,222 < N < 105,638), and tested potential mediators and moderators of the association between autism, childhood trauma and SSBI. Autism PGS were significantly associated with childhood trauma (max R<sup>2</sup> = 0.096%, P < 2 × 10<sup>-16</sup>), self-harm ideation (max R<sup>2</sup> = 0.108%, P < 2 × 10<sup>-16</sup>), and self-harm (max R<sup>2</sup> = 0.13%, P < 2 × 10<sup>-16</sup>). Supporting this, we identified significant genetic correlations between autism and childhood trauma (r<sub>g</sub> = 0.36 ± 0.05, P = 8.13 × 10<sup>-11</sup>), self-harm ideation (r<sub>g</sub> = 0.49 ± 0.05, P = 4.17 × 10<sup>-21</sup>) and self-harm (r<sub>g</sub> = 0.48 ± 0.05, P = 4.58 × 10<sup>-21</sup>), and an over-transmission of PGS for the two SSBI phenotypes from parents to autistic probands. Male sex negatively moderated the effect of autism PGS on childhood trauma (β = -0.023 ± 0.005, P = 6.74 × 10<sup>-5</sup>). Further, childhood trauma positively moderated the effect of autism PGS on self-harm score (β = 8.37 × 10<sup>-3</sup> ± 2.76 × 10<sup>-3</sup>, P = 2.42 × 10<sup>-3</sup>) and self-harm ideation (β = 7.47 × 10<sup>-3</sup> ± 2.76 × 10<sup>-3</sup>, P = 6.71 × 10<sup>-3</sup>). Finally, depressive symptoms, quality and frequency of social interactions, and educational attainment were significant mediators of the effect of autism PGS on SSBI, with the proportion of effect mediated ranging from 0.23 (95% CI: 0.09-0.32) for depression to 0.008 (95% CI: 0.004-0.01) for educational attainment. Our findings identify that a genetic predisposition for autism is associated with adverse life-time outcomes, which represent complex gene-environment interactions, and prioritizes potential mediators and moderators of this shared biology. It is important to identify sources of trauma for autistic individuals in order to reduce their occurrence and impact.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Very large sample sizes are often needed to capture heterogeneity in autism, necessitating data sharing across multiple studies with diverse assessment instruments. In these cases, data harmonization can be a critical tool for deriving a single dataset for analysis. This can be done through computational approaches that enable the conversion of scores across various instruments. To this end, our study examined the use of analytical approaches for mapping scores on two measures of adaptive functioning, namely predicting the scores on the vineland adaptive behavior scales II (VABS) from the scores on the adaptive behavior assessment system II (ABAS).<h4>Methods</h4>Data from the province of Ontario neurodevelopmental disorders network were used. The dataset included scores VABS and the ABAS for 720 participants (autism n = 547, 433 male, age: 11.31 ± 3.63 years; neurotypical n = 173, 95 male, age: 12.53 ± 4.05 years). Six regression approaches (ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression, ridge regression, ElasticNet, LASSO, AdaBoost, random forest) were used to predict VABS total scores from the ABAS scores, demographic variables (age, sex), and phenotypic measures (diagnosis; core and co-occurring features; IQ; internalizing and externalizing symptoms).<h4>Results</h4>The VABS scores were significantly higher than the ABAS scores in the autism group, but not the neurotypical group (median difference: 8, 95% CI = (7,9)). The difference was negatively associated with age (beta = -1.2 ± 0.12, t = -10.6, p < 0.0001). All estimators demonstrated similar performance, with no statistically significant differences in mean absolute error (MAE) values across estimators (MAE range: 4.96-6.91). The highest contributing features to the prediction model were ABAS composite score, diagnosis, and age.<h4>Limitations</h4>This study has several strengths, including the large sample. We did not examine the conversion of domain scores across the two measures of adaptive functioning and suggest this as a future area of investigation.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Overall, our results supported the feasibility of harmonization. Our results suggest that a linear regression model trained on the ABAS composite score, the ABAS raw domain scores, and age, sex, and diagnosis would provide an acceptable trade-off between accuracy, parsimony, and data collection and processing complexity.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition, which is characterized by clinical heterogeneity and high heritability. Core symptoms of ASD include deficits in social communication and interaction, as well as restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. Many genes have been identified that are associated with an increased risk for ASD. Proteins encoded by these ASD risk genes are often involved in processes related to fetal brain development, chromatin modification and regulation of gene expression in general, as well as the structural and functional integrity of synapses. Genes of the SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains (SHANK) family encode crucial scaffolding proteins (SHANK1-3) of excitatory synapses and other macromolecular complexes. SHANK gene mutations are highly associated with ASD and more specifically the Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMDS), which is caused by heterozygous 22q13.3-deletion resulting in SHANK3-haploinsufficiency, or by SHANK3 missense variants. SHANK3 deficiency and potential treatment options have been extensively studied in animal models, especially in mice, but also in rats and non-human primates. However, few of the proposed therapeutic strategies have translated into clinical practice yet.<h4>Main text</h4>This review summarizes the literature concerning SHANK3-deficient animal models. In particular, the structural, behavioral, and neurological abnormalities are described and compared, providing a broad and comprehensive overview. Additionally, the underlying pathophysiologies and possible treatments that have been investigated in these models are discussed and evaluated with respect to their effect on ASD- or PMDS-associated phenotypes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Animal models of SHANK3 deficiency generated by various genetic strategies, which determine the composition of the residual SHANK3-isoforms and affected cell types, show phenotypes resembling ASD and PMDS. The phenotypic heterogeneity across multiple models and studies resembles the variation of clinical severity in human ASD and PMDS patients. Multiple therapeutic strategies have been proposed and tested in animal models, which might lead to translational implications for human patients with ASD and/or PMDS. Future studies should explore the effects of new therapeutic approaches that target genetic haploinsufficiency, like CRISPR-mediated activation of promotors.},

	Abstract = {Adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are frequently prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). However, there is limited evidence to support this practice. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the impact of SSRIs on brain function abnormalities in ASD. It has been suggested that some core symptoms in ASD are underpinned by deficits in executive functioning (EF). Hence, we investigated the role of the SSRI citalopram on EF networks in 19 right-handed adult males with ASD and 19 controls who did not differ in gender, age, IQ or handedness. We performed pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare brain activity during two EF tasks (of response inhibition and sustained attention) after an acute dose of 20 mg citalopram or placebo using a randomised, double-blind, crossover design. Under placebo condition, individuals with ASD had abnormal brain activation in response inhibition regions, including inferior frontal, precentral and postcentral cortices and cerebellum. During sustained attention, individuals with ASD had abnormal brain activation in middle temporal cortex and (pre)cuneus. After citalopram administration, abnormal brain activation in inferior frontal cortex was 'normalised' and most of the other brain functional differences were 'abolished'. Also, within ASD, the degree of responsivity in inferior frontal and postcentral cortices to SSRI challenge was related to plasma serotonin levels. These findings suggest that citalopram can 'normalise' atypical brain activation during EF in ASD. Future trials should investigate whether this shift in the biology of ASD is maintained after prolonged citalopram treatment, and if peripheral measures of serotonin predict treatment response.},

The 4-year follow-up included the CAST and the Checklist for Referral (CFR). All with CAST ≥15, phase 1 diagnostic assessment or with developmental concerns on the CFR were invited for diagnostic assessment (phase 2). Standardised diagnostic assessment at both time-points was conducted to establish the test accuracy of the Q-CHAT.<h4>Main outcome measures</h4>Consensus diagnostic outcome at phase 1 and phase 2.<h4>Results</h4>At phase 1, 3770 Q-CHATs were returned (29% response) and 121 undertook diagnostic assessment, of whom 11 met the criteria for autism. All 11 screened positive on the Q-CHAT. The positive predictive value (PPV) at a cut-point of 39 was 17% (95% CI 8% to 31%). At phase 2, 2005 of 3472 CASTs and CFRs were returned (58% response). 159 underwent diagnostic assessment, including 82 assessed in phase 1. All children meeting the criteria for autism identified via the Q-CHAT at phase 1 also met the criteria at phase 2. The PPV was 28% (95% CI 15% to 46%) after phase 1 and phase 2.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The Q-CHAT can be used at 18-30 months to identify autism and enable accelerated referral for diagnostic assessment. The low PPV suggests that for every true positive there would, however, be ~4-5 false positives. At follow-up, new cases were identified, illustrating the need for continued surveillance and rescreening at multiple time-points using developmentally sensitive instruments. Not all children who later receive a diagnosis of autism are detectable during the toddler period.},

	Abstract = {Brain dynamic functional connectivity characterises transient connections between brain regions, changing over time. Features of brain dynamics have been linked to emotion and cognition in adult individuals, and atypical patterns have been associated with neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism. Although reliable functional brain networks have been consistently identified in neonates, little is known about the early development of dynamic functional connectivity. In this study we characterise dynamic functional connectivity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in the first few weeks of postnatal life in term-born ( n = 324) and preterm-born ( n = 66) individuals. We show that a dynamic landscape of brain connectivity is already established by the time of birth in the human brain, characterised by six transient states of neonatal functional connectivity with changing dynamics through the neonatal period. The pattern of dynamic connectivity is atypical in preterm-born infants, and associated with atypical social, sensory, and repetitive behaviours measured by the Quantitative Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (Q-CHAT) scores at 18 months of age.},

	Abstract = {Social-communication (SC) and restricted repetitive behaviors (RRB) are autism diagnostic symptom domains. SC and RRB severity can markedly differ within and between individuals and may be underpinned by different neural circuitry and genetic mechanisms. Modeling SC-RRB balance could help identify how neural circuitry and genetic mechanisms map onto such phenotypic heterogeneity. Here, we developed a phenotypic stratification model that makes highly accurate (97-99%) out-of-sample SC = RRB, SC > RRB, and RRB > SC subtype predictions. Applying this model to resting state fMRI data from the EU-AIMS LEAP dataset (n = 509), we find that while the phenotypic subtypes share many commonalities in terms of intrinsic functional connectivity, they also show replicable differences within some networks compared to a typically-developing group (TD). Specifically, the somatomotor network is hypoconnected with perisylvian circuitry in SC > RRB and visual association circuitry in SC = RRB. The SC = RRB subtype show hyperconnectivity between medial motor and anterior salience circuitry. Genes that are highly expressed within these networks show a differential enrichment pattern with known autism-associated genes, indicating that such circuits are affected by differing autism-associated genomic mechanisms. These results suggest that SC-RRB imbalance subtypes share many commonalities, but also express subtle differences in functional neural circuitry and the genomic underpinnings behind such circuitry.},

	Abstract = {Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Childhood Apraxia of Speech (CAS) are developmental disorders with distinct diagnostic criteria and different epidemiology. However, a common genetic background as well as overlapping clinical features between ASD and CAS have been recently reported. To date, brain structural language-related abnormalities have been detected in both the conditions, but no study directly compared young children with ASD, CAS and typical development (TD). In the current work, we aim: (i) to test the hypothesis that ASD and CAS display neurostructural differences in comparison with TD through morphometric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-based measures (ASD vs. TD and CAS vs. TD); (ii) to investigate early possible disease-specific brain structural patterns in the two clinical groups (ASD vs. CAS); (iii) to evaluate predictive power of machine-learning (ML) techniques in differentiating the three samples (ASD, CAS, TD). We retrospectively analyzed the T1-weighted brain MRI scans of 68 children (age range: 34-74 months) grouped into three cohorts: (1) 26 children with ASD (mean age ± standard deviation: 56 ± 11 months); (2) 24 children with CAS (57 ± 10 months); (3) 18 children with TD (55 ± 13 months). Furthermore, a ML analysis based on a linear-kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM) was performed. All but one brain structures displayed significant higher volumes in both ASD and CAS children than TD peers. Specifically, ASD alterations involved fronto-temporal regions together with basal ganglia and cerebellum, while CAS alterations are more focused and shifted to frontal regions, suggesting a possible speech-related anomalies distribution. Caudate, superior temporal and hippocampus volumes directly distinguished the two conditions in terms of greater values in ASD compared to CAS. The ML analysis identified significant differences in brain features between ASD and TD children, whereas only some trends in the ML classification capability were detected in CAS as compared to TD peers. Similarly, the MRI structural underpinnings of two clinical groups were not significantly different when evaluated with linear-kernel SVM. Our results may represent the first step towards understanding shared and specific neural substrate in ASD and CAS conditions, which subsequently may contribute to early differential diagnosis and tailoring specific early intervention.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Previous research using the Sensory Perception Quotient (SPQ) has reported greater sensory hypersensitivity in people with autism spectrum condition (ASC) compared to controls, consistent with other research. However, current scoring of the SPQ does not differentiate between hyper and hyposensitivity, making it uncertain whether individuals with ASC might also show differences in hyposensitivity. Furthermore, no research to date has focused on sensory differences in females, and whether differences in sensory sensitivity extend to the broader autism phenotype (BAP). The present study aimed to fill these gaps.<h4>Methods</h4>The present study developed and validated a Revised Scoring of the Sensory Perception Quotient (SPQ-RS) in order to investigate self-reported hypersensitivity and hyposensitivity in three groups of adults: a female ASC group (n = 152), mothers of children with ASC (BAP mothers group; n = 103), and a control mothers group (n = 74). All participants completed the SPQ as a self-report measure of sensory processing and the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) as a measure of the degree of autism traits.<h4>Results</h4>The female ASC group reported significantly more hypersensitivity, but not more hyposensitivity, compared to the control female and BAP mothers groups. The BAP mothers group did not differ from the control mothers group in either reported hypersensitivity (p = .365) or hyposensitivity (p = .075), suggesting atypical sensory sensitivity is not a BAP trait within females. SPQ-RS hypersensitivity scores positively correlated with autistic traits in the female ASC (r = .266) and BAP mothers groups (r = .350).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The present findings revealed greater sensory hypersensitivity, but not hyposensitivity, in females with ASC compared to BAP and control female groups, and that a greater degree of autism traits relates to higher hypersensitivity in ASC females. The results offer support for the enhanced perceptual functioning model using large samples of females, who are an understudied population, and demonstrate the validity of the SPQ-RS as a valuable new research tool for exploring self-reported hypersensitivity and hyposensitivity.},

	Abstract = {SHANK3 is a member of the SHANK family of scaffolding proteins that localize to the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses. Mutations within the <i>SHANK3</i> gene or <i>SHANK3</i> haploinsufficiency is thought to be one of the major causes for Phelan-McDermid Syndrome (PMDS) that is characterized by a broad spectrum of autism-related behavioral alterations. Several approaches have already been proposed to elevate SHANK3 protein levels in PMDS patients like transcriptional activation or inhibition of SHANK3 degradation. We undertook a systematic screening approach and tested whether defined antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) directed against the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the human <i>SHANK3</i> mRNA are suitable to elevate SHANK3 protein levels. Using human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and hiPSCs-derived motoneurons from controls and PMDS patients we eventually identified two 18 nucleotide ASOs (ASO 4-5.2-4 and 4-5.2-6) that were able to increase SHANK3 protein levels <i>in vitro</i> by about 1.3- to 1.6-fold. These findings were confirmed by co-transfection of the identified ASOs with a GFP-SHANK3-3'-UTR construct in HEK293T cells using GFP protein expression as read-out. Based on these results we propose a novel approach to elevate SHANK3 protein concentrations by 3'-UTR specific ASOs. Further research is needed to test the suitability of <i>SHANK3</i>-specific ASOs as pharmacological compounds also <i>in vivo</i>.},

	Abstract = {Levels of sociability are continuously distributed in the general population, and decreased sociability represents an early manifestation of several brain disorders. Here, we investigated the genetic underpinnings of sociability in the population. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of a sociability score based on four social functioning-related self-report questions from 342,461 adults in the UK Biobank. Subsequently we performed gene-wide and functional follow-up analyses. Robustness analyses were performed in the form of GWAS split-half validation analyses, as well as analyses excluding neuropsychiatric cases. Using genetic correlation analyses as well as polygenic risk score analyses we investigated genetic links of our sociability score to brain disorders and social behavior outcomes. Individuals with autism spectrum disorders, bipolar disorder, depression, and schizophrenia had a lower sociability score. The score was significantly heritable (SNP h<sup>2</sup> of 6%). We identified 18 independent loci and 56 gene-wide significant genes, including genes like ARNTL, DRD2, and ELAVL2. Many associated variants are thought to have deleterious effects on gene products and our results were robust. The sociability score showed negative genetic correlations with autism spectrum, disorders, depression, schizophrenia, and two sociability-related traits-loneliness and social anxiety-but not with bipolar disorder or Alzheimer's disease. Polygenic risk scores of our sociability GWAS were associated with social behavior outcomes within individuals with bipolar disorder and with major depressive disorder. Variation in population sociability scores has a genetic component, which is relevant to several psychiatric disorders. Our findings provide clues towards biological pathways underlying sociability.},

	Abstract = {Tourette syndrome (TS) is characterized by multiple motor and vocal tics, and high-comorbidity rates with other neuropsychiatric disorders. Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), major depressive disorder (MDD), and anxiety disorders (AXDs) are among the most prevalent TS comorbidities. To date, studies on TS brain structure and function have been limited in size with efforts mostly fragmented. This leads to low-statistical power, discordant results due to differences in approaches, and hinders the ability to stratify patients according to clinical parameters and investigate comorbidity patterns. Here, we present the scientific premise, perspectives, and key goals that have motivated the establishment of the Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis for TS (ENIGMA-TS) working group. The ENIGMA-TS working group is an international collaborative effort bringing together a large network of investigators who aim to understand brain structure and function in TS and dissect the underlying neurobiology that leads to observed comorbidity patterns and clinical heterogeneity. Previously collected TS neuroimaging data will be analyzed jointly and integrated with TS genomic data, as well as equivalently large and already existing studies of highly comorbid OCD, ADHD, ASD, MDD, and AXD. Our work highlights the power of collaborative efforts and transdiagnostic approaches, and points to the existence of different TS subtypes. ENIGMA-TS will offer large-scale, high-powered studies that will lead to important insights toward understanding brain structure and function and genetic effects in TS and related disorders, and the identification of biomarkers that could help inform improved clinical practice.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Importance</h4>What is inherited or acquired in neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is not a fixed outcome, but instead is a vulnerability to a spectrum of traits, especially social difficulties. Identifying the biological mechanisms associated with vulnerability requires looking as early in life as possible, before the brain is shaped by postnatal mechanisms and/or the experiences of living with these traits. Animal studies suggest that susceptibility to neurodevelopmental disorders arises when genetic and/or environmental risks for these conditions alter patterns of synchronous brain activity in the perinatal period, but this has never been examined in human neonates.<h4>Objective</h4>To assess whether alternation of functional maturation of social brain circuits is associated with a family history of ASD in newborns.<h4>Design, setting, and participants</h4>In this cohort study of 36 neonates with and without a family history of ASD, neonates underwent magnetic resonance imaging at St Thomas Hospital in London, England, using a dedicated neonatal brain imaging system between June 23, 2015, and August 1, 2018. Neonates with a first-degree relative with ASD (R+) and therefore vulnerable to autistic traits and neonates without a family history (R-) were recruited for the study. Synchronous neural activity in brain regions linked to social function was compared.<h4>Main outcomes and measures</h4>Regions responsible for social function were selected with reference to a published meta-analysis and the level of synchronous activity within each region was used as a measure of local functional connectivity in a regional homogeneity analysis. Group differences, controlling for sex, age at birth, age at scan, and group × age interactions, were examined.<h4>Results</h4>The final data set consisted of 18 R+ infants (13 male; median [range] postmenstrual age at scan, 42.93 [40.00-44.86] weeks) and 18 R- infants (13 male; median [range] postmenstrual age at scan, 42.50 [39.29-44.58] weeks). Neonates who were R+ had significantly higher levels of synchronous activity in the right posterior fusiform (t = 2.48; P = .04) and left parietal cortices (t = 3.96; P = .04). In addition, there was a significant group × age interaction within the anterior segment of the left insula (t = 3.03; P = .04) and cingulate cortices (right anterior: t = 3.00; P = .03; left anterior: t = 2.81; P = .03; right posterior: t = 2.77; P = .03; left posterior: t = 2.55; P = .03). In R+ infants, levels of synchronous activity decreased over 39 to 45 weeks' postmenstrual age, whereas synchronous activity levels increased in R- infants over the same period.<h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4>Synchronous activity is required during maturation of functionally connected networks. This study found that in newborn humans, having a first-degree relative with ASD was associated with higher levels of local functional connectivity and dysmaturation of interconnected regions responsible for processing higher-order social information.},

	Abstract = {Human mutations and haploinsufficiency of the SHANK family genes are associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID). Complex phenotypes have been also described in all mouse models of Shank mutations and deletions, consistent with the heterogeneity of the human phenotypes. However, the specific role of Shank proteins in synapse and neuronal functions remain to be elucidated. Here, we generated a new mouse model to investigate how simultaneously deletion of Shank1 and Shank3 affects brain development and behavior in mice. Shank1-Shank3 DKO mice showed a low survival rate, a developmental strong reduction in the activation of intracellular signaling pathways involving Akt, S6, ERK1/2, and eEF2 during development and a severe behavioral impairments. Our study suggests that Shank1 and Shank3 proteins are essential to developmentally regulate the activation of Akt and correlated intracellular pathways crucial for mammalian postnatal brain development and synaptic plasticity. Therefore, Akt function might represent a new therapeutic target for enhancing cognitive abilities of syndromic ASD patients.},

	Abstract = {Neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD), anorexia nervosa (AN), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and schizophrenia (SZ), are heterogeneous brain disorders with unknown etiology. Genome wide studies have revealed a wide variety of risk genes for these disorders, indicating a biological link between genetic signaling pathways and brain pathology. A unique risk gene is Contactin 4 (Cntn4), an Ig cell adhesion molecule (IgCAM) gene, which has been associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders including ASD, AN, AD, and SZ. Here, we investigated the Cntn4 gene knockout (KO) mouse model to determine whether memory dysfunction and altered brain plasticity, common neuropsychiatric symptoms, are affected by Cntn4 genetic disruption. For that purpose, we tested if Cntn4 genetic disruption affects CA1 synaptic transmission and the ability to induce LTP in hippocampal slices. Stimulation in CA1 striatum radiatum significantly decreased synaptic potentiation in slices of Cntn4 KO mice. Neuroanatomical analyses showed abnormal dendritic arborization and spines of hippocampal CA1 neurons. Short- and long-term recognition memory, spatial memory, and fear conditioning responses were also assessed. These behavioral studies showed increased contextual fear conditioning in heterozygous and homozygous KO mice, quantified by a gene-dose dependent increase in freezing response. In comparison to wild-type mice, Cntn4-deficient animals froze significantly longer and groomed more, indicative of increased stress responsiveness under these test conditions. Our electrophysiological, neuro-anatomical, and behavioral results in Cntn4 KO mice suggest that Cntn4 has important functions related to fear memory possibly in association with the neuronal morphological and synaptic plasticity changes in hippocampus CA1 neurons.},

	Abstract = {A fundamental challenge in developing treatments for autism spectrum disorders is the heterogeneity of the condition. More than one hundred genetic mutations confer high risk for autism, with each individual mutation accounting for only a small fraction of cases<sup>1-3</sup>. Subsets of risk genes can be grouped into functionally related pathways, most prominently those involving synaptic proteins, translational regulation, and chromatin modifications. To attempt to minimize this genetic complexity, recent therapeutic strategies have focused on the neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin<sup>4-6</sup>, which regulate aspects of social behaviour in mammals<sup>7</sup>. However, it is unclear whether genetic risk factors predispose individuals to autism as a result of modifications to oxytocinergic signalling. Here we report that an autism-associated mutation in the synaptic adhesion molecule Nlgn3 results in impaired oxytocin signalling in dopaminergic neurons and in altered behavioural responses to social novelty tests in mice. Notably, loss of Nlgn3 is accompanied by a disruption of translation homeostasis in the ventral tegmental area. Treatment of Nlgn3-knockout mice with a new, highly specific, brain-penetrant inhibitor of MAP kinase-interacting kinases resets the translation of mRNA and restores oxytocin signalling and social novelty responses. Thus, this work identifies a convergence between the genetic autism risk factor Nlgn3, regulation of translation, and oxytocinergic signalling. Focusing on such common core plasticity elements might provide a pragmatic approach to overcoming the heterogeneity of autism. Ultimately, this would enable mechanism-based stratification of patient populations to increase the success of therapeutic interventions.},

Here, we extend the application of these biomarkers of prenatal and early postnatal elemental metabolism to distinguish between individuals diagnosed with ADHD and/or ASD and neurotypical controls. We recruited twins discordant for ADHD, ASD and other neurodevelopmental diagnoses from national twin studies in Sweden (N = 74) diagnosed according to DSM-5 clinical consensus and standardized psychiatric instruments. Detailed temporal profiles of exposure to 10 metals over the prenatal and early childhood periods were measured using tooth biomarkers. We used recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) to characterize properties of cyclical metabolic patterns of these metals. Regularity (determinism) and complexity (entropy) of elemental cycles was consistently reduced in ADHD for cobalt, lead, and vanadium (determinism: cobalt, β = -0.03, P = 0.017; lead, β = -0.03, P = 0.016; and vanadium, β = -0.03, P = 0.01. Entropy: cobalt, β = -0.13, P = 0.017; lead, β = -0.18, P = 0.016; and vanadium, β = -0.15, P = 0.008). Further, we found elemental pathways and dynamical features specific to ADHD vs ASD, and unique characteristics associated with ADHD/ASD combined presentation. Dysregulation of cyclical processes in elemental metabolism during prenatal and early postnatal development not only encompasses pathways shared by ADHD and ASD, but also comprise features specific to either condition.},

	Abstract = {The Empathizing-Systemizing (E-S) theory of typical sex differences suggests that individuals may be classified based on empathy and systemizing. An extension of the E-S theory, the Extreme Male Brain (EMB) theory suggests that autistic people on average have a shift towards a more masculinized brain along the E-S dimensions. Both theories have been investigated in small sample sizes, limiting their generalizability. Here we leverage two large datasets (discovery <i>n</i> = 671,606, including 36,648 autistic individuals primarily; and validation <i>n</i> = 14,354, including 226 autistic individuals) to investigate 10 predictions of the E-S and the EMB theories. In the discovery dataset, typical females on average showed higher scores on short forms of the Empathy Quotient (EQ) and Sensory Perception Quotient (SPQ), and typical males on average showed higher scores on short forms of the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) and Systemizing Quotient (SQ). Typical sex differences in these measures were attenuated in autistic individuals. Analysis of "brain types" revealed that typical females on average were more likely to be Type E (EQ > SQ) or Extreme Type E and that typical males on average were more likely to be Type S (SQ > EQ) or Extreme Type S. In both datasets, autistic individuals, regardless of their reported sex, on average were "masculinized." Finally, we demonstrate that D-scores (difference between EQ and SQ) account for 19 times more of the variance in autistic traits (43%) than do other demographic variables including sex. Our results provide robust evidence in support of both the E-S and EMB theories.},

	Abstract = {Autism is characterized by atypical social communication and stereotyped behaviors. Mutations in the gene encoding the synaptic scaffolding protein SHANK3 are detected in 1-2% of patients with autism and intellectual disability, but the mechanisms underpinning the symptoms remain largely unknown. Here, we characterized the behavior of <i>Shank3</i> <sup>Δ11/Δ11</sup> mice from 3 to 12 months of age. We observed decreased locomotor activity, increased stereotyped self-grooming and modification of socio-sexual interaction compared to wild-type littermates. We then used RNAseq on four brain regions of the same animals to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). DEGs were identified mainly in the striatum and were associated with synaptic transmission (e.g., <i>Grm2, Dlgap1</i>), G-protein-signaling pathways (e.g., <i>Gnal</i>, <i>Prkcg1</i>, <i>and Camk2g</i>), as well as excitation/inhibition balance (e.g., <i>Gad2</i>). Downregulated and upregulated genes were enriched in the gene clusters of medium-sized spiny neurons expressing the dopamine 1 (D1-MSN) and the dopamine 2 receptor (D2-MSN), respectively. Several DEGs (<i>Cnr1</i>, <i>Gnal</i>, <i>Gad2</i>, <i>and Drd4</i>) were reported as striosome markers. By studying the distribution of the glutamate decarboxylase GAD65, encoded by <i>Gad2</i>, we showed that the striosome compartment of <i>Shank3</i> <sup>Δ11/Δ11</sup> mice was enlarged and displayed much higher expression of GAD65 compared to wild-type mice. Altogether, these results indicate altered gene expression in the striatum of <i>Shank3</i>-deficient mice and strongly suggest, for the first time, that the excessive self-grooming of these mice is related to an imbalance in the striatal striosome and matrix compartments.},

	Abstract = {The low employment rates of persons with Autism Spectrum Conditions in the European Union (EU) are partly due to discrimination. Member States have taken different approaches to increase the employment rate in the recent decades, including quota and anti-discrimination legislation, however, the implications for people with autism are unknown. The purpose of this scoping review was to provide a comprehensive overview of the history of these employment policies, from seven EU Member States (Germany, France, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom [prior to exit], Slovakia, Poland, and Romania), exploring the interdependence on international and EU policies, using a path dependency analysis. The results indicate that internationally a shift in focus has taken place in the direction of anti-discrimination law, though employment quotas remained in place in six out of the seven Member States as a means to address employment of people with disability in combination with the new anti-discrimination laws. LAY SUMMARY: Discrimination is partially responsible for the low employment of people with autism. Several approaches have been taken in recent years, such as anti-discrimination laws and setting a mandatory number of people with disabilities that need to be employed. This study finds that, internationally and in the European Union, the focus was initially on the use of quotas and gradually moved to anti-discrimination, with both being used simultaneously.

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Autism is a heterogeneous collection of disorders with a complex molecular underpinning. Evidence from postmortem brain studies have indicated that early prenatal development may be altered in autism. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) generated from individuals with autism with macrocephaly also indicate prenatal development as a critical period for this condition. But little is known about early altered cellular events during prenatal stages in autism.<h4>Methods</h4>iPSCs were generated from 9 unrelated individuals with autism without macrocephaly and with heterogeneous genetic backgrounds, and 6 typically developing control individuals. iPSCs were differentiated toward either cortical or midbrain fates. Gene expression and high throughput cellular phenotyping was used to characterize iPSCs at different stages of differentiation.<h4>Results</h4>A subset of autism-iPSC cortical neurons were RNA-sequenced to reveal autism-specific signatures similar to postmortem brain studies, indicating a potential common biological mechanism. Autism-iPSCs differentiated toward a cortical fate displayed impairments in the ability to self-form into neural rosettes. In addition, autism-iPSCs demonstrated significant differences in rate of cell type assignment of cortical precursors and dorsal and ventral forebrain precursors. These cellular phenotypes occurred in the absence of alterations in cell proliferation during cortical differentiation, differing from previous studies. Acquisition of cell fate during midbrain differentiation was not different between control- and autism-iPSCs.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Taken together, our data indicate that autism-iPSCs diverge from control-iPSCs at a cellular level during early stage of neurodevelopment. This suggests that unique developmental differences associated with autism may be established at early prenatal stages.},

	Abstract = {Mapping infant neurocognitive differences that precede later ADHD-related behaviours is critical for designing early interventions. In this study, we investigated (1) group differences in a battery of measures assessing aspects of attention and activity level in infants with and without a family history of ADHD or related conditions (ASD), and (2) longitudinal associations between the infant measures and preschool ADHD traits at 3 years. Participants (<i>N</i> = 151) were infants with or without an elevated likelihood for ADHD (due to a family history of ADHD and/or ASD). A multi-method assessment protocol was used to assess infant attention and activity level at 10 months of age that included behavioural, cognitive, physiological and neural measures. Preschool ADHD traits were measured at 3 years of age using the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) and the Child Behaviour Questionnaire (CBQ). Across a broad range of measures, we found no significant group differences in attention or activity level at 10 months between infants with and without a family history of ADHD or ASD. However, parent and observer ratings of infant activity level at 10 months were positively associated with later preschool ADHD traits at 3 years. Observable behavioural differences in activity level (but not attention) may be apparent from infancy in children who later develop elevated preschool ADHD traits.},

In contrast to the normative profile of increases in attentional control scores between infancy and toddlerhood, a minority (7-9%) showed plateauing attentional control scores between 10 and 25 months. Consistent with pre-registered hypotheses, plateaued growth of attentional control was associated with elevated autism and ADHD traits, and lower adaptive functioning at age 3 years.},

The ABCD cohort study (start 9-10 years old) underlined the developmental significance of early socioemotional and prenatal risks as well as toxin exposure. The KiGGS cohort followed children and adolescents from age 0-17 years up to the ages of 10-28 years. Main findings underline the importance of the socioeconomic status and gender-specific effects with respect to sensitive periods for the onset and trajectories of psychiatric disorders. The AIMS cohort followed patients with and without autism spectrum disorders aged between 6 and 30 years and first results revealed small effects regarding group differences. Further, cohort studies starting prenatally along with deep phenotyping are warranted to uncover the complex etiology of mental disorders.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Existing cohort studies on early mental development have shown specific focal points. To identify general and specific risk and resilience factors for psychiatric disorders and to model trajectories, there is a need for multimodal integration of data sets.},

Education and disability policies remain within the competence of EU Member States, with current educational standards and provisions for autistic people implemented locally. This scoping review aims to map EU and national special education policies with the goal of scoping the level of fulfilment of the right to education of autistic people.<h4>Methods</h4>Four EU countries (United Kingdom, France, Poland and Spain) were included in this scoping review study. Governmental policies in the field of education, special education needs and disability law were included. Path dependency framework was used for data analysis; a net of inter-dependencies between international, EU and national policies was created.<h4>Results and discussion</h4>Each country created policies where the right to free education without discrimination is provided. Poland does not have an autism specific strategy, whereas the United Kingdom, France and Spain have policies specifically designed for autistic individuals. Within the United Kingdom, all countries created different autism plans, nevertheless all aim to reach the same goal-inclusive education for autistic children that leads to the development of their full potential.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Policy-making across Europe in the field of education has been changing through the years in favour of autistic people. Today their rights are noticed and considered, but there is still room for improvement. Results showed that approaches and policies vastly differ between countries, more Member States should be analysed in a similar manner to gain a broader and clearer view with a special focus on disability rights in Central and Eastern Europe.},

	Abstract = {Research efforts over the past decades have unraveled both genetic and environmental factors, which contribute to the development of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). It is, to date, largely unknown how different underlying causes result in a common phenotype. However, the individual course of development and the different comorbidities might reflect the heterogeneous genetic and non-genetic contributions. Therefore, it is reasonable to identify commonalities and differences in models of these disorders at the different hierarchical levels of brain function, including genetics/environment, cellular/synaptic functions, brain regions, connectivity, and behavior. To that end, we investigated <i>Shank3</i> transgenic mouse lines and compared them with a prenatal zinc-deficient (PZD) mouse model of ASD at the level of brain structural alterations in an 11,7 T small animal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Animals were measured at 4 and 9 weeks of age. We identified a decreased total brain volume (TBV) and hippocampal size of <i>Shank3</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice but a convergent increase of basal ganglia (striatum and globus pallidus) in most mouse lines. Moreover, <i>Shank3</i> transgenic mice had smaller thalami, whereas PZD mice had this region enlarged. Intriguingly, <i>Shank3</i> heterozygous knockout mice mostly showed minor abnormalities to full knockouts, which might reflect the importance of proper <i>Shank3</i> dosage in neuronal cells. Most reported volume changes seemed to be more pronounced at younger age. Our results indicate both convergent and divergent brain region abnormalities in genetic and non-genetic models of ASD. These alterations of brain structures might be mirrored in the reported behavior of both models, which have not been assessed in this study.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Autistic individuals without intellectual disability are at heightened risk of self-injury, and appear to engage in it for similar reasons as non-autistic people. A wide divergence of autistic perspectives on self-injury, including those who frame it as a helpful coping mechanism, motivate investigating the link between self-injury, suicide ideation, and attempts which has been reported in typically developing individuals.<h4>Method</h4>One hundred three autistic participants completed the Non-Suicidal Self-Injury Assessment Tool (NSSI-AT), the Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire (SBQ-R), and the Interpersonal Social Evaluation List (ISEL-12) across two online studies. Logistic regression was conducted to predict self-harming status via responses to questions on suicidality, and to predict whether certain self-injurious behaviors, including cutting, were especially associated with suicide ideation and attempts. Non-parametric correlation analysis examined relationships between suicide ideation/attempts and other variables that might characterize self-harmers especially at risk of suicidality. These included perceived access to social support, purposes or reasons for self-injury, the number of different self-injurious behaviors engaged in, the duration and lifetime incidence of self-injury, and the individual's feelings about their self-injury.<h4>Results</h4>While self-injuring status was significantly predicted by responses to a question on suicide ideation and attempts, there was no relationship between suicide ideation/attempts and a participant's personal feelings about their self-injury. The method of cutting was also predicted by suicide ideation and attempts, though other methods common in autistic people were at borderline significance. Use of self-injury for the regulation of low-energy emotional states like depression, for self-punishment or deterrence from suicide, and for sensory stimulation, was associated with suicide ideation and attempts, as was the number of self-injurious behaviors engaged in. There was no significant relationship between suicide ideation/attempts and the duration and lifetime incidence of self-injury or social support.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These preliminary data suggest that while individuals might frame their self-injury as a positive or neutral thing, there remains a concerning relationship between self-injury and suicidality which exists regardless of individual feelings on self-injury. This is consistent with the theoretical perspective that self-injury can be a "gateway" through which individuals acquire capability for lethal suicidal behaviors. The data highlight that particular methods (cutting) and reasons for self-injury may be of significant concern, but this information, which might be of extreme value for clinicians, requires further investigation and validation.},

Also common are repetitive behaviors and altered social interactions, in line with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders. This study investigated the developmental aspect of autism-related behaviors and other phenotypes in a <i>Shank3</i>-transgenic mouse model. The animals underwent two sets of identical behavioral experiments, spanning motor skills, social and repetitive behavior, and cognition: baseline began at 5 weeks of age, corresponding to human adolescence, and the follow-up was initiated when aged 13 weeks, resembling early adulthood in humans. Interestingly, the animals displayed relatively stable phenotypes. Moreover, motor coordination and endurance were impaired, while muscle strength was unchanged. Surprisingly, the animals displayed only minor impairments in social behavior, but pronounced stereotypic and repetitive behaviors. Some behavioral tests indicated increased avoidance and anxiety. While spatial learning and memory were unchanged, knockout animals displayed slightly impaired cognitive flexibility. Female animals had similar abnormalities as males in the paradigms testing avoidance, anxiety, and cognition, but were less pathological in motor function and repetitive behavior. In all test paradigms, heterozygous <i>Shank3</i> knockout animals had either no abnormal or a milder phenotype. Accurate characterization of animal models for genetic diseases is a prerequisite for understanding the pathophysiology.

	Abstract = {In the last decade there has been a revolution in terms of genetic findings in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), with many discoveries critical for understanding their aetiology and pathophysiology. Clinical trials in single-gene disorders such as fragile X syndrome highlight the challenges of investigating new drug targets in NDDs. Incorporating a developmental perspective into the process of drug development for NDDs could help to overcome some of the current difficulties in identifying and testing new treatments. This paper provides a summary of the proceedings of the 'New Frontiers Meeting' on neurodevelopmental disorders organised by the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology in conjunction with the Innovative Medicines Initiative-sponsored AIMS-2-TRIALS consortium. It brought together experts in developmental genetics, autism, NDDs, and clinical trials from academia and industry, regulators, patient and family associations, and other stakeholders. The meeting sought to provide a platform for focused communication on scientific insights, challenges, and methodologies that might be applicable to the development of CNS treatments from a neurodevelopmental perspective. Multidisciplinary translational consortia to develop basic and clinical research in parallel could be pivotal to advance knowledge in the field. Although implementation of clinical trials for NDDs in paediatric populations is widely acknowledged as essential, safety concerns should guide each aspect of their design. Industry and academia should join forces to improve knowledge of the biology of brain development, identify the optimal timing of interventions, and translate these findings into new drugs, allowing for the needs of users and families, with support from regulatory agencies.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Polygenicity and genetic heterogeneity pose great challenges for studying psychiatric conditions. Genetically informed approaches have been implemented in neuroimaging studies to address this issue. However, the effects on functional connectivity of rare and common genetic risks for psychiatric disorders are largely unknown. Our objectives were to estimate and compare the effect sizes on brain connectivity of psychiatric genomic risk factors with various levels of complexity: oligogenic copy number variants (CNVs), multigenic CNVs, and polygenic risk scores (PRSs) as well as idiopathic psychiatric conditions and traits.<h4>Methods</h4>Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were processed using the same pipeline across 9 datasets. Twenty-nine connectome-wide association studies were performed to characterize the effects of 15 CNVs (1003 carriers), 7 PRSs, 4 idiopathic psychiatric conditions (1022 individuals with autism, schizophrenia, bipolar conditions, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder), and 2 traits (31,424 unaffected control subjects).<h4>Results</h4>Effect sizes on connectivity were largest for psychiatric CNVs (estimates: 0.2-0.65 z score), followed by psychiatric conditions (0.15-0.42), neuroticism and fluid intelligence (0.02-0.03), and PRSs (0.01-0.02). Effect sizes of CNVs on connectivity were correlated to their effects on cognition and risk for disease (r = 0.9, p = 5.93 × 10<sup>-6</sup>). However, effect sizes of CNVs adjusted for the number of genes significantly decreased from small oligogenic to large multigenic CNVs (r = -0.88, p = 8.78 × 10<sup>-6</sup>). PRSs had disproportionately low effect sizes on connectivity compared with CNVs conferring similar risk for disease.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Heterogeneity and polygenicity affect our ability to detect brain connectivity alterations underlying psychiatric manifestations.},

	Abstract = {Autism is a diagnostic label based on behavior. While the diagnostic criteria attempt to maximize clinical consensus, it also masks a wide degree of heterogeneity between and within individuals at multiple levels of analysis. Understanding this multi-level heterogeneity is of high clinical and translational importance. Here we present organizing principles to frame research examining multi-level heterogeneity in autism. Theoretical concepts such as 'spectrum' or 'autisms' reflect non-mutually exclusive explanations regarding continuous/dimensional or categorical/qualitative variation between and within individuals. However, common practices of small sample size studies and case-control models are suboptimal for tackling heterogeneity. Big data are an important ingredient for furthering our understanding of heterogeneity in autism. In addition to being 'feature-rich', big data should be both 'broad' (i.e., large sample size) and 'deep' (i.e., multiple levels of data collected on the same individuals). These characteristics increase the likelihood that the study results are more generalizable and facilitate evaluation of the utility of different models of heterogeneity. A model's utility can be measured by its ability to explain clinically or mechanistically important phenomena, and also by explaining how variability manifests across different levels of analysis. The directionality for explaining variability across levels can be bottom-up or top-down, and should include the importance of development for characterizing changes within individuals. While progress can be made with 'supervised' models built upon a priori or theoretically predicted distinctions or dimensions of importance, it will become increasingly important to complement such work with unsupervised data-driven discoveries that leverage unknown and multivariate distinctions within big data. A better understanding of how to model heterogeneity between autistic people will facilitate progress towards precision medicine for symptoms that cause suffering, and person-centered support.},

Here, we demonstrate a LNL-ISO polygenic score contribution to schizophrenia risk in an independent case-control sample (N = 3,488). We then subset schizophrenia predisposing variation based on its effect on LNL-ISO. We find that genetic variation with concordant effects in both phenotypes shows significant SNP-based heritability enrichment, higher polygenic contribution in females, and positive covariance with mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, alcohol dependence, and autism. Conversely, genetic variation with discordant effects only contributes to schizophrenia risk in males and is negatively correlated with those disorders. Mendelian randomization analyses demonstrate a plausible bi-directional causal relationship between LNL-ISO and schizophrenia, with a greater effect of LNL-ISO liability on schizophrenia than vice versa. These results illustrate the genetic footprint of LNL-ISO on schizophrenia.},

In this paper, we mapped policies relevant to special education needs and parental involvement of children with autism at an international level and in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium.<h4>Methods</h4>A policy path analysis was performed using a scoping review as an underlying methodological framework. This allowed for a rapid gathering of available data from which a timeline of adopted policies was derived.<h4>Results and discussion</h4>Internationally, the universal right to education has been reinforced repeatedly and the values of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights have been reiterated with every reinforcement. Also, the additional support that a child with special education needs requires is acknowledged and measures are taken to facilitate access to any education for all children. There are slight cross-country differences between the countries under study, attributable to differences in national regulation of education. However, all countries have progressed to a state where the right to education for all children is integrated on a policy level and measures are taken to enable children with special needs to participate in education. Recently, an attempt to implement a form of inclusive education was made as a form of special needs provision. Nevertheless, nowhere has this been implemented successfully yet.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was a critical juncture in international policy and created an environment where the universal right to education has been implemented for all children in the countries under study.},

	Abstract = {Left-right asymmetry of the human brain is one of its cardinal features, and also a complex, multivariate trait. Decades of research have suggested that brain asymmetry may be altered in psychiatric disorders. However, findings have been inconsistent and often based on small sample sizes. There are also open questions surrounding which structures are asymmetrical on average in the healthy population, and how variability in brain asymmetry relates to basic biological variables such as age and sex. Over the last 4 years, the ENIGMA-Laterality Working Group has published six studies of gray matter morphological asymmetry based on total sample sizes from roughly 3,500 to 17,000 individuals, which were between one and two orders of magnitude larger than those published in previous decades. A population-level mapping of average asymmetry was achieved, including an intriguing fronto-occipital gradient of cortical thickness asymmetry in healthy brains. ENIGMA's multi-dataset approach also supported an empirical illustration of reproducibility of hemispheric differences across datasets. Effect sizes were estimated for gray matter asymmetry based on large, international, samples in relation to age, sex, handedness, and brain volume, as well as for three psychiatric disorders: autism spectrum disorder was associated with subtly reduced asymmetry of cortical thickness at regions spread widely over the cortex; pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder was associated with altered subcortical asymmetry; major depressive disorder was not significantly associated with changes of asymmetry. Ongoing studies are examining brain asymmetry in other disorders. Moreover, a groundwork has been laid for possibly identifying shared genetic contributions to brain asymmetry and disorders.},

	Abstract = {While previous research has investigated neuroradiological findings in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the entire range of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) has not yet been well-studied using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Considering the overlap among NDDs and simultaneous development of the brain and face, guided by molecular signaling, we examined the relationship of actionable and incidental (non-actionable) MRI findings and NDD diagnoses together with facial morphological variants and genetic copy number variants (CNVs). A cross-sectional study was conducted with a twin cohort 8-36 years of age (57% monozygotic, 40% dizygotic), including 372 subjects (46% with NDDs; 47% female) imaged by MRI, 280 with data for facial morphological variants, and 183 for CNVs. Fifty-one percent of participants had MRI findings. Males had a statistically significantly higher percentage of MRI findings (57.7%) compared with females (43.8%, p = 0.03). Twin zygosity was not statistically significantly correlated with incidence or severity of specific MRI findings. No statistically significant association was found between MRI findings and any NDD diagnosis or facial morphological variants; however, MRI findings were statistically significantly associated with the number of CNVs (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.00-1.44, p = 0.05, adjusted OR for sex 1.24, 95% CI 1.03-1.50, p = 0.02). When combining the presence of MRI findings, facial morphological variants, and CNVs, statistically significant relationships were found with ASD and ADHD diagnoses (p = 0.0006 and p = 0.002, respectively). The results of this study demonstrate that the ability to identify NDDs from combined radiology, morphology, and CNV assessments may be possible. Additionally, twins do not appear to be at increased risk for neuroradiological variants.},

	Abstract = {Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a chronic mental illness and among the most debilitating conditions encountered in medical practice. A recent landmark SCZ study of the protein-coding regions of the genome identified a causal role for ten genes and a concentration of rare variant signals in evolutionarily constrained genes<sup>1</sup>. This recent study-and most other large-scale human genetics studies-was mainly composed of individuals of European (EUR) ancestry, and the generalizability of the findings in non-EUR populations remains unclear. To address this gap, we designed a custom sequencing panel of 161 genes selected based on the current knowledge of SCZ genetics and sequenced a new cohort of 11,580 SCZ cases and 10,555 controls of diverse ancestries. Replicating earlier work, we found that cases carried a significantly higher burden of rare protein-truncating variants (PTVs) among evolutionarily constrained genes (odds ratio = 1.48; P = 5.4 × 10<sup>-6</sup>). In meta-analyses with existing datasets totaling up to 35,828 cases and 107,877 controls, this excess burden was largely consistent across five ancestral populations. Two genes (SRRM2 and AKAP11) were newly implicated as SCZ risk genes, and one gene (PCLO) was identified as shared by individuals with SCZ and those with autism. Overall, our results lend robust support to the rare allelic spectrum of the genetic architecture of SCZ being conserved across diverse human populations.},

	Abstract = {Balance between inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitter systems and the protective role of the major antioxidant glutathione (GSH) are central to early healthy brain development. Disruption has been implicated in the early life pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders and neurodevelopmental conditions including Autism Spectrum Disorder. Edited magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) methods such as HERMES have great potential for providing important new non-invasive insights into these crucial processes in human infancy. In this work, we describe a systematic approach to minimise the impact of specific technical challenges inherent to acquiring MRS data in a neonatal population, including automatic segmentation, full tissue-correction and optimised GABA+ fitting and consider the minimum requirements for a robust edited-MRS acquisition. With this approach we report for the first time simultaneous GABA+, Glx (glutamate + glutamine) and GSH concentrations in the neonatal brain (n = 18) in two distinct regions (thalamus and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)) using edited MRS at 3T. The improved sensitivity provided by our method allows specific regional neurochemical differences to be identified including: significantly lower Glx and GSH ratios to total creatine in the thalamus compared to the ACC (p < 0.001 for both), and significantly higher GSH levels in the ACC following tissue-correction (p < 0.01). Furthermore, in contrast to adult GABA+ which can typically be accurately fitted with a single peak, all neonate spectra displayed a characteristic doublet GABA+ peak at 3 ppm, indicating a lower macromolecule (MM) contribution to the 3 ppm signal in neonates. Relatively high group-level variance shows the need to maximise voxel size/acquisition time in edited neonatal MRS acquisitions for robust estimation of metabolites. Application of this method to study how these levels and balance are altered by early-life brain injury or genetic risk can provide important new knowledge about the pathophysiology underlying neurodevelopmental disorders.},

IFN-γ activates an antiviral cellular state, limiting viral entry and replication. Moreover, IFN-γ is implicated in brain development. We tested the hypothesis that IFN-γ signaling contributes to molecular and cellular phenotypes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Transient IFN-γ treatment of neural progenitors derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells increased neurite outgrowth. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) genes were persistently up-regulated through neuronal differentiation-an effect that was mediated by IFN-γ-induced promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies. Critically, IFN-γ-induced neurite outgrowth required both PML and MHCI. We also found evidence that IFN-γ disproportionately altered the expression of genes associated with schizophrenia and autism, suggesting convergence between genetic and environmental risk factors. Together, these data implicate IFN-γ signaling in neurodevelopmental disorder etiology.},

We investigated the evolutionary pressures acting on almost all human protein-coding genes (<i>N</i> = 11,667; 1:1 orthologs in primates) based on their divergence from those of early hominins, such as Neanderthals, and non-human primates. We confirm that genes encoding brain-related proteins are among the most strongly conserved protein-coding genes in the human genome. Combining our evolutionary pressure metrics for the protein-coding genome with recent data sets, we found that this conservation applied to genes functionally associated with the synapse and expressed in brain structures such as the prefrontal cortex and the cerebellum. Conversely, several genes presenting signatures commonly associated with positive selection appear as causing brain diseases or conditions, such as micro/macrocephaly, Joubert syndrome, dyslexia, and autism. Among those, a number of DNA damage response genes associated with microcephaly in humans such as <i>BRCA1</i>, <i>NHEJ1</i>, <i>TOP3A</i>, and <i>RNF168</i> show strong signs of positive selection and might have played a role in human brain size expansion during primate evolution. We also showed that cerebellum granule neurons express a set of genes also presenting signatures of positive selection and that may have contributed to the emergence of fine motor skills and social cognition in humans. This resource is available online and can be used to estimate evolutionary constraints acting on a set of genes and to explore their relative contributions to human traits.},

Previous neuroimaging studies examining the neuroanatomical underpinnings of 22q11.2DS show alterations in cortical volume (CV), cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA). The aim of this study was to identify (1) the spatially distributed networks of differences in CT and SA in 22q11.2DS compared to controls, (2) their unique and spatial overlap, as well as (3) their relative contribution to observed differences in CV. Structural MRI scans were obtained from 62 individuals with 22q11.2DS and 57 age-and-gender-matched controls (aged 6-31). Using FreeSurfer, we examined differences in vertex-wise estimates of CV, CT and SA at each vertex, and compared the frequencies of vertices with a unique or overlapping difference for each morphometric feature. Our findings indicate that CT and SA make both common and unique contributions to volumetric differences in 22q11.2DS, and in some areas, their strong opposite effects mask differences in CV. By identifying the neuroanatomic variability in 22q11.2DS, and the separate contributions of CT and SA, we can start exploring the shared and distinct mechanisms that mediate neuropsychiatric symptoms across disorders, e.g. 22q11.2DS-related ASD and/or psychosis/schizophrenia.},

	Abstract = {Brain function is a product of the balance between excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) brain activity. Variation in the regulation of this activity is thought to give rise to normal variation in human traits, and disruptions are thought to potentially underlie a spectrum of neuropsychiatric conditions (e.g., Autism, Schizophrenia, Downs' Syndrome, intellectual disability). Hypotheses related to E/I dysfunction have the potential to provide cross-diagnostic explanations and to combine genetic and neurological evidence that exists within and between psychiatric conditions. However, the hypothesis has been difficult to test because: (1) it lacks specificity-an E/I dysfunction could pertain to any level in the neural system- neurotransmitters, single neurons/receptors, local networks of neurons, or global brain balance - most researchers do not define the level at which they are examining E/I function; (2) We lack validated methods for assessing E/I function at any of these neural levels in humans. As a result, it has not been possible to reliably or robustly test the E/I hypothesis of psychiatric disorders in a large cohort or longitudinal patient studies. Currently available, in vivo markers of E/I in humans either carry significant risks (e.g., deep brain electrode recordings or using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with radioactive tracers) and/or are highly restrictive (e.g., limited spatial extent for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS). More recently, a range of novel Electroencephalography (EEG) features has been described, which could serve as proxy markers for E/I at a given level of inference. Thus, in this perspective review, we survey the theories and experimental evidence underlying 6 novel EEG markers and their biological underpinnings at a specific neural level. These cheap-to-record and scalable proxy markers may offer clinical utility for identifying subgroups within and between diagnostic categories, thus directing more tailored sub-grouping and, therefore, treatment strategies. However, we argue that studies in clinical populations are premature. To maximize the potential of prospective EEG markers, we first need to understand the link between underlying E/I mechanisms and measurement techniques.},

	Abstract = {Intellectual functioning is a critical determinant of economic and personal productivity. Identifying early neural predictors of cognitive function in infancy will allow us to map the neurodevelopmental pathways that underpin individual differences in intellect. Here, in three different cohorts we investigate the association between a putative neurophysiological indicator of information encoding (change in frontal theta during a novel video) in infancy and later general cognitive outcome. In a discovery cohort of 12-month-old typically developing infants, we recorded EEG during presentation of dynamic movies of people and objects. Frontal theta power (3-6 Hz) significantly increased during the course of viewing each video. Critically, increase in frontal theta during viewing of a video was associated with a differential response to repetition of that specific video, confirming relation to learning. Further, individual differences in the magnitude of change in frontal theta power were related to concurrent nonverbal cognitive level. We then sought to extend this association in two independent samples enriched for variation in cognitive outcome due to the inclusion of infants at familial risk for autism. We observed similar patterns of theta EEG change at 12 months, and found a predictive relation to verbal and nonverbal cognitive skills measured at 2, 3 and 7 years of age. For the subset of high-risk infants later diagnosed with autism, infant theta EEG explained over 80% of the variance in nonverbal skills at age 3 years. We suggest that EEG theta change in infancy is an excellent candidate predictive biomarker that could yield substantial insight into the mechanisms that underlie individual differences in childhood intelligence, particularly in high risk populations.},

However, it also stressed the magnitude of inequalities regarding accessing digital health. Using a scoping review, this article explores the potential benefits of digital technologies for the global population, with particular reference to people living with disabilities, using the autism community as a case study. We ultimately explore policies in Sweden, Australia, Canada, Estonia, the United Kingdom, and the United States to learn how policies can lay an inclusive foundation for digital health systems. We conclude that digital health ecosystems should be designed with health equity at the forefront to avoid deepening existing health inequalities. We call for a more sophisticated understanding of digital health literacy to better assess the readiness to adopt digital health innovations. Finally, people living with disabilities should be positioned at the center of digital health policy and innovations to ensure they are not left behind.},

	Abstract = {Abnormal EEG features are a hallmark of epilepsy, and abnormal frequency and network features are apparent in EEGs from people with idiopathic generalized epilepsy in both ictal and interictal states. Here, we characterize differences in the resting-state EEG of individuals with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and assess factors influencing the heterogeneity of EEG features. We collected EEG data from 147 participants with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy through the Biology of Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy study. Ninety-five control EEGs were acquired from two independent studies [Chowdhury <i>et al</i>. (2014) and EU-AIMS Longitudinal European Autism Project]. We extracted frequency and functional network-based features from 10 to 20 s epochs of resting-state EEG, including relative power spectral density, peak alpha frequency, network topology measures and brain network ictogenicity: a computational measure of the propensity of networks to generate seizure dynamics. We tested for differences between epilepsy and control EEGs using univariate, multivariable and receiver operating curve analysis. In addition, we explored the heterogeneity of EEG features within and between cohorts by testing for associations with potentially influential factors such as age, sex, epoch length and time, as well as testing for associations with clinical phenotypes including anti-seizure medication, and seizure characteristics in the epilepsy cohort. <i>P</i>-values were corrected for multiple comparisons. Univariate analysis showed significant differences in power spectral density in delta (2-5 Hz) (<i>P</i> = 0.0007, hedges' g = 0.55) and low-alpha (6-9 Hz) (<i>P</i> = 2.9 × 10<sup>-8</sup>, g = 0.80) frequency bands, peak alpha frequency (<i>P</i> = 0.000007, g = 0.66), functional network mean degree (<i>P</i> = 0.0006, g = 0.48) and brain network ictogenicity (<i>P</i> = 0.00006, g = 0.56) between epilepsy and controls. Since age (<i>P</i> = 0.009) and epoch length (<i>P</i> = 1.7 × 10<sup>-8</sup>) differed between the two groups and were potential confounders, we controlled for these covariates in multivariable analysis where disparities in EEG features between epilepsy and controls remained. Receiver operating curve analysis showed low-alpha power spectral density was optimal at distinguishing epilepsy from controls, with an area under the curve of 0.72. Lower average normalized clustering coefficient and shorter average normalized path length were associated with poorer seizure control in epilepsy patients. To conclude, individuals with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy have increased power of neural oscillatory activity at low-alpha frequencies, and increased brain network ictogenicity compared with controls, supporting evidence from studies in other epilepsies with considerable external validity. In addition, the impact of confounders on different frequency-based and network-based EEG features observed in this study highlights the need for careful consideration and control of these factors in future EEG research in idiopathic generalized epilepsy particularly for their use as biomarkers.},

	Abstract = {Helsmoortel-Van der Aa syndrome (HVDAS) is a neurodevelopmental condition associated with intellectual disability/developmental delay, autism spectrum disorder, and multiple medical comorbidities. HVDAS is caused by mutations in activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP). A recent study identified genome-wide DNA methylation changes in 22 individuals with HVDAS, adding to the group of neurodevelopmental disorders with an epigenetic signature. This methylation signature segregated those with HVDAS into two groups based on the location of the mutations. Here, we conducted an independent study on 24 individuals with HVDAS and replicated the existence of the two mutation-dependent episignatures. To probe whether the two distinct episignatures correlate with clinical outcomes, we used deep behavioral and neurobiological data from two prospective cohorts of individuals with a genetic diagnosis of HVDAS. We found limited phenotypic differences between the two HVDAS-affected groups and no evidence that individuals with more widespread methylation changes are more severely affected. Moreover, in spite of the methylation changes, we observed no profound alterations in the blood transcriptome of individuals with HVDAS. Our data warrant caution in harnessing methylation signatures in HVDAS as a tool for clinical stratification, at least with regard to behavioral phenotypes.},

	Abstract = {Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been associated with increased risk for physical comorbidity. This study used a twin cohort to investigate the association between physical diseases and phenotypic variations of ADHD. A twin cohort enriched for ADHD and other neurodevelopmental conditions were analysed. The Attention Problems subscale of the Child Behavior Checklist/Adult Behavior Checklist (CBCL/ABCL-AP) was used to measure the participants' severity of ADHD symptoms. Physical health issues were obtained with a validated questionnaire and were tested in relation to ADHD symptom severity in a co-twin control model. Neurological problems were significantly associated with a diagnosis of ADHD. A conditional model for the analysis of within-twin pair effects revealed an inverse association between digestive problems and the severity of ADHD symptoms, after adjusting for co-existing autism spectrum disorder and ADHD medications. Our findings suggest that individuals with ADHD are susceptible to neurological problems, why a thorough neurological check-up is indicated in clinical practice for this population. In addition, health conditions of digestive system could be considered as a non-shared environmental factor for behavioral phenotypes in ADHD. It supports the possible role of gut-brain axis in the underpinnings of ADHD symptoms, at least for a subgroup of individuals with certain genetic predisposition.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Importance</h4>Large-scale neuroimaging studies have revealed group differences in cortical thickness across many psychiatric disorders. The underlying neurobiology behind these differences is not well understood.<h4>Objective</h4>To determine neurobiologic correlates of group differences in cortical thickness between cases and controls in 6 disorders: attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), bipolar disorder (BD), major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and schizophrenia.<h4>Design, setting, and participants</h4>Profiles of group differences in cortical thickness between cases and controls were generated using T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. Similarity between interregional profiles of cell-specific gene expression and those in the group differences in cortical thickness were investigated in each disorder. Next, principal component analysis was used to reveal a shared profile of group difference in thickness across the disorders. Analysis for gene coexpression, clustering, and enrichment for genes associated with these disorders were conducted. Data analysis was conducted between June and December 2019. The analysis included 145 cohorts across 6 psychiatric disorders drawn from the ENIGMA consortium. The numbers of cases and controls in each of the 6 disorders were as follows: ADHD: 1814 and 1602; ASD: 1748 and 1770; BD: 1547 and 3405; MDD: 2658 and 3572; OCD: 2266 and 2007; and schizophrenia: 2688 and 3244.<h4>Main outcomes and measures</h4>Interregional profiles of group difference in cortical thickness between cases and controls.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 12 721 cases and 15 600 controls, ranging from ages 2 to 89 years, were included in this study. Interregional profiles of group differences in cortical thickness for each of the 6 psychiatric disorders were associated with profiles of gene expression specific to pyramidal (CA1) cells, astrocytes (except for BD), and microglia (except for OCD); collectively, gene-expression profiles of the 3 cell types explain between 25% and 54% of variance in interregional profiles of group differences in cortical thickness. Principal component analysis revealed a shared profile of difference in cortical thickness across the 6 disorders (48% variance explained); interregional profile of this principal component 1 was associated with that of the pyramidal-cell gene expression (explaining 56% of interregional variation). Coexpression analyses of these genes revealed 2 clusters: (1) a prenatal cluster enriched with genes involved in neurodevelopmental (axon guidance) processes and (2) a postnatal cluster enriched with genes involved in synaptic activity and plasticity-related processes. These clusters were enriched with genes associated with all 6 psychiatric disorders.<h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4>In this study, shared neurobiologic processes were associated with differences in cortical thickness across multiple psychiatric disorders. These processes implicate a common role of prenatal development and postnatal functioning of the cerebral cortex in these disorders.},

The exact pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the disease are still far from being deciphered but studies of SHANK3 models have contributed to the understanding of how the loss of the synaptic protein SHANK3 affects neuronal function.<h4>Methods and results</h4>Diffusion tensor imaging-based and automatic volumetric brain mapping were performed in 12 SHANK3-deficient participants (mean age 19 ± 15 years) versus 14 age- and gender-matched controls (mean age 29 ± 5 years). Using whole brain-based spatial statistics, we observed a highly significant pattern of white matter alterations in participants with SHANK3 mutations with focus on the long association fiber tracts, particularly the uncinate tract and the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. In contrast, only subtle gray matter volumetric abnormalities were detectable. In a back-translational approach, we observed similar white matter alterations in heterozygous isoform-specific Shank3 knockout (KO) mice. Here, in the baseline data sets, the comparison of Shank3 heterozygous KO vs wildtype showed significant fractional anisotropy reduction of the long fiber tract systems in the KO model. The multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) analysis by DTI and volumetry demonstrated a pathology pattern with severe white matter alterations and only subtle gray matter changes in the animal model.<h4>Interpretation</h4>In summary, these translational data provide strong evidence that the SHANK3-deficiency-associated pathomechanism presents predominantly with a white matter disease. Further studies should concentrate on the role of SHANK3 during early axonal pathfinding/wiring and in myelin formation.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>The inability to observe relevant biological processes in vivo significantly restricts human neurodevelopmental research. Advances in appropriate in vitro model systems, including patient-specific human brain organoids and human cortical spheroids (hCSs), offer a pragmatic solution to this issue. In particular, hCSs are an accessible method for generating homogenous organoids of dorsal telencephalic fate, which recapitulate key aspects of human corticogenesis, including the formation of neural rosettes-in vitro correlates of the neural tube. These neurogenic niches give rise to neural progenitors that subsequently differentiate into neurons. Studies differentiating induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) in 2D have linked atypical formation of neural rosettes with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum conditions. Thus far, however, conventional methods of tissue preparation in this field limit the ability to image these structures in three-dimensions within intact hCS or other 3D preparations. To overcome this limitation, we have sought to optimise a methodological approach to process hCSs to maximise the utility of a novel Airy-beam light sheet microscope (ALSM) to acquire high resolution volumetric images of internal structures within hCS representative of early developmental time points.<h4>Results</h4>Conventional approaches to imaging hCS by confocal microscopy were limited in their ability to image effectively into intact spheroids. Conversely, volumetric acquisition by ALSM offered superior imaging through intact, non-clarified, in vitro tissues, in both speed and resolution when compared to conventional confocal imaging systems. Furthermore, optimised immunohistochemistry and optical clearing of hCSs afforded improved imaging at depth. This permitted visualization of the morphology of the inner lumen of neural rosettes.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We present an optimized methodology that takes advantage of an ALSM system that can rapidly image intact 3D brain organoids at high resolution while retaining a large field of view. This imaging modality can be applied to both non-cleared and cleared in vitro human brain spheroids derived from hiPSCs for precise examination of their internal 3D structures. This process represents a rapid, highly efficient method to examine and quantify in 3D the formation of key structures required for the coordination of neurodevelopmental processes in both health and disease states. We posit that this approach would facilitate investigation of human neurodevelopmental processes in vitro.},
