# Contributing to *Autistic Participatory Metrics*

Thank you for your interest in this citizen-driven project.
We welcome support and contributions from autistic people, allies, students, and researchers working in autism science.

Given that the vast majority of the analysed materials (peer-reviewed publications) and all of the analytical tools (bibliographic libraries and open-source scripts) are public and accessible to anyone, the project ensures **full transparency in its sources, methods, and objectives**.

This openness also enables individuals to contribute anonymously, if preferred.
