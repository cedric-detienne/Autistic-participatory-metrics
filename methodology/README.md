# Autistic Participatory Metrics

**Status:** *Preliminary research phase*

## Methodology

The methodology is currently under development and will be progressively documented in this section.  
It aims to support the creation of empirical tools to evaluate participatory practices in autism research, particularly the involvement of autistic individuals in study design, implementation, and dissemination.

A dedicated bibliographic database is maintained in BibTeX format to support this work.  
It includes references on participatory research, evaluation frameworks, and methodological principles.

üìÅ The file is located at: [`methodology/jabref/participation_studies.bib`](jabref/)  
It can be opened and edited using [JabRef](https://www.jabref.org/), and will evolve as the project progresses.
