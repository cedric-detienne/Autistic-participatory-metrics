  abstract = {The growth of the neurodiversity movement has brought about new ethical, theoretical, and political debates within autism theory and research. These debates bring forth the pressing issue of developing better practices for neurodiversity-affirmative research. In this chapter, we focus on how R2D2-MH—a large international biomedical project on Risk and Resilience in Developmental Diversity and Mental Health—works with neurodivergent knowledge production. R2D2-MH aims to improve the mental health outcomes of young neurodivergent people across the lifespan. Therefore, this biomedical project made it a priority to work with co-creation groups and explicitly engage with neurodivergent communities. We write from the perspectives of our different roles in R2D2-MH: facilitator and member of the adult co-creation group, and member of R2D2-MH scientific advisory board. We draw on collaborative autoethnographic methodology to explore and reflect upon our experiences of co-creation and neurodiverse (A neurodiverse space is one where multiple neurocognitive styles are represented (Walker, 2021).)

research spaces during the first year of R2D2-MH. In this chapter, we are imagining possibilities for such an international co-creation group not only as an add-on to the project but as an integrated part of the research project. Within this chapter, we consider the limits and possibilities of a neurodiverse research collaboration, while paying attention to how this way of doing research has the potential to be a caring, epistemic healing experience, as well as a learning experience for all people involved.},

  abstract = {I've been doing a happy dance lately, ever since learning that a manuscript I contributed to was recently accepted for publication in Psychological Science. In fact, I'm just about as excited as I was 25 years ago when I received my first editorial acceptance. Only this time, I didn't receive the notification directly; rather, it was forwarded to me by another author, because on this manuscript I'm merely the third of four coauthors. The first author conceived the study, initiated the data collection, supervised the statistical analyses, and wrote the first draft. The study empirically challenges conventional wisdom and provides a powerful demonstration of the level and nature of autistic intelligence. The first author, Michelle Dawson, is autistic.1 

Like many autistic people, Ms. Dawson is very interested in the topics in which she's interested. She reads so prodigiously that she's known as the living PubMed around my lab. At least once a week, we find ourselves emailing her to ask if she knows of “any other studies on ...,” and within an hour, we receive an annotated bibliography, much of it from her memory. She's a polished writer, and most of all, she's a scrupulous thinker. These days, I wouldn't fathom submitting an article (or even one of my APS Presidential columns) without first seeking her no-holds-barred critique. 

Ms. Dawson is not the only autistic who takes a keen interest in autism research and who reads voraciously, thinks analytically, and writes prolifically on the subject. Amanda Baggs, an autistic who relies primarily on augmentative communication for speaking, maintains the blog, “Ballastexistenz,” which means “ballast-life,” a term from the German eugenics program that targeted disabled people. One recent post presented an analysis of the autistic children in Leo Kanner's original sample, implicitly demonstrating how some autism researchers and the general public have incorrectly used the term “Kanner's autism.” The analysis emulated a grade-A answer on a doctoral prelim exam. 

Joel Smith, an autistic who often relies on augmentative communication devices for speaking, maintains the website, “This Way of Life.” On the site's associated blog, Smith recently provided a tutorial on probability that would rival any introductory statistics lecture. Another autistic's blog, “Natural Variation,” which “dispels junk science in the autism field, scrutinizes questionable treatments, and exposes stereotypes and demeaning characterizations,” recently explicated the placebo effect observed in the multimillion-dollar NIH-funded studies of secretin2 and did so with precision far beyond that found in the studies’ peer-reviewed articles. 

Listservs, Yahoo groups, and even Second Life are teeming with autistics’ informed and articulate discussions of autism research — from persuasive deconstructions of their putative lack of mirror neurons, empathy, and theory of mind, to provocative hypotheses about atypical minicolumns, Purkinje cells, and 2D:4D ratios, to book-club-like discussions of the classics. Press releases, conference presentations, and journal articles are devoured and digested, sometimes with burps as simple as “no sh*t, Sherlock” (in response to a Nature Neuroscience publication of mine). 

However, autistics are almost never consulted by autism researchers (thereby violating the mantra of disability rights, “Nothing About Us, Without Us”), and often they are explicitly excluded. Ms. Dawson has documented Canadian research conferences that barred autistics from attending but curiously welcomed parents of autistic minors as expert contributors. 

Why haven't autistics’ own voices been heard? Why haven't autistics been as actively recruited to participate in all aspects of the research process as they've been recruited to participate as research subjects (even posthumously by donating their brain tissue)? 

Perhaps it's assumed that autistics just wouldn't be able to handle high-level research. If so, someone ought to tell Vernon Smith, who was awarded the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics (alongside APS Fellow Daniel Kahneman) for pioneering the field of experimental economics. And somebody better alert Richard Borcherds, who was awarded the mathematics equivalent of the Nobel Prize — the Fields Medal — in 1998. Both academics are diagnosed autistics. 

It takes just a cursory stroll through history to view the shocking collage of groups deemed incapable of stepping up to the research plate. In 20th century psychological science alone, we have Mary Whiton Caulkins, the brilliant protege of William James who, by lack of a Y chromosome, was denied her PhD at Harvard (but who later became APA's first female president). It's quite unlikely that APA's founder and first (male) president, G. Stanley Hall, believed that members of ethnic minority groups would be suitable research collaborators, given his disturbing attribution of “adolescent races” who “would be better in mind, body, and morals if they knew no education.” 

Or perhaps it's believed that by including autistics as research collaborators, objectivity would be foiled. As I hope my previous APS Presidential columns have illustrated, a lot of research on autistics (and research on other groups) is far from objective. As Graham Richards, former historian of the British Psychology Society, has stated, the “general consensus that the scientist detached from the rest of humanity in some realm of pure objectivity has ceased to be a professional ideal, and it was always in any case an unreasonable one.” 

Besides, I know deaf psychological scientists who study deaf language and culture, blind psychological scientists who study vision, and gay psychological scientists who study sexual orientation. Heck, psychological scientists who study perception and sensation have a long tradition of studying themselves. I underscore Richards’ conviction that the study of group differences can only be “socially responsible” if the research is “undertaken by teams drawn from or including members of these groups.” 

MacArthur “Genius” award recipient Harlan Lane similarly articulated the primary way to make deaf research socially and ethically responsible: “involve deaf people themselves at all levels of the undertaking. Federal agencies such as the Department of Education and the National Institutes of Health, which support most research on deaf people in the United States, should ... require the projects they sponsor to turn preferentially to the deaf community for advisers and collaborators in research design and implementation, for assistance in data collection and analysis, for guidance in interpretation of results.” 

NIH already has a mechanism in place for involving autistics through pre- and postdoctoral fellowships that “encourage and enable students with disabilities to seek graduate degrees, and thus further the goal of increasing the number of scientists with disabilities who are prepared to pursue careers in biomedical and behavioral research.” Aside from graduate training, autistics can ably serve as research collaborators, consultants, and advisers, which doesn't mean being what my 10-year old son and other autistic self-advocates call a “walking zoo exhibit.” Autistics deserve a full seat at the main table. As former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan charged, “no society can claim to be based on justice and equality without persons with disabilities making decisions as full-fledged members.” 

How to achieve that goal? In her “Open Letter to the Workplace,” Jane Meyerding, program coordinator for international studies at the University of Washington, recommends the following: “What autistics, whether we can ‘pass’ [as non-autistics] or not, are asking for is that other people leave room for us. Us as we are. Even if we ‘look autistic’ or ‘act autistic’ or use alternate means of communication. Don't require that we look and sound like you, because some of us can't. Don't judge us on the job (or during the job interview) according to how well we perform the social dance. Give us a chance to show what we can do when who we are is allowed to help shape the world we share with you.” 

In addition to the ethical imperative of including autistics as true research participants, there are scientific motivations. Nobel Laureate Smith reminds us that “we've lost a lot of the barriers that have to do with skin color and with various other characteristics. But there's still not sufficient recognition of mental diversities. I think it's different kinds of minds, and the recognition that certain mental deficiencies may actually have some selective advantages in terms of activities.” Smith gives the example of his ability to “switch out and go into a concentrated mode ... If I'm writing something, nothing else exists.” Who wouldn't want that in a coauthor? 

“Perhaps even more importantly,” Smith relates, “I don't have any trouble thinking outside the box. And so I have been more open to different ways of looking at a lot of the problems in economics.” I value highly autistics’ diverse perspective, focused interest, and heightened sense of social justice, along with their occasional jolts of gallows humor. For example, upon reading that the Lifetime Achievement address at the upcoming International Meeting for Autism Research would be titled, “Autism and the Absent Self,” Ms. Dawson posted to a discussion board, “so if I attend, I won't really be there? I'll be that empty chair in the back row.”},

Approach  This article explores the development of the PARC network, reflecting upon its activities and ethos within current Higher Education (HE) practices and structures.    Findings  In supporting autistic individuals in their attempts to establish themselves within academic systems that may not always be considerate or accommodating, the existence of PARC creates a structure  with which autistic people can influence social change. PARC serves as a network of support, strengthening the presence of autistic scholars in academia. It also provides a structure through which autistic people are able to demonstrate helpful practices with which to engage more broadly.    Value  The PARC network is the first autistic-led venture of its kind in the UK to have a sustained impact. PARC is growing to become an important element in the field of autism studies both by supporting the emerging autistic academics and by promoting ethical and participatory research methods and practices.},

  abstract = {Purpose
Interpretative phenomenological analysis is distinctive in foregrounding participants’ interpretations. As such, it is potentially useful for gaining an insight into the lived experience of autistic individuals and aligns well with participatory approaches. This paper provides the first systematic review of IPA studies that have employed a participatory approach and considers their contribution to Critical Autism Studies.

Method
Four electronic databases were searched to identify peer-reviewed empirical research articles which employed a participatory IPA approach to consult with autistic individuals. Thirteen studies from four countries, published 2008–2018, met the inclusion criteria. These were examined to identify details of the methodology, findings and recommendations in order to consider each in relation to the underpinning philosophies of IPA and participatory research respectively, and their relationship to the stated aims of Critical Autism Studies.

Results
A range of participatory approaches were employed and their use extended the depth and validity of findings. There was evidence of disruption to power relations in process and outcomes. Making sense of the autism diagnosis was a frequent point of discussion, even when this was not the focus of the study, and across studies, strong commonalities emerged, capturing a multi-dimensionality of ‘autistic identities’.

Conclusion
This review provides evidence of the usefulness of IPA as a research approach to consult with autistic individuals. It lends itself to a range of participatory techniques and there is scope for these to be used with diverse autistic populations, in order to extend the opportunities for autistic individuals to be represented, and represent themselves, within autism research.},

@article{Pellicano2019,
  abstract = {There is a growing movement toward participatory research in the field of autism (Chown et al., 2017; Fletcher-Watson et al., 2019; Nicolaidis et al., 2011). This movement is in part driven by a dissatisfaction by the Autistic and autism communities with the preponderance of research focusing on the underlying biology and causes of autism rather than on research that has a meaningful impact on people’s dayto-day lives (Pellicano, Dinsmore, & Charman, 2014). In our view, this reflects a wider movement in healthrelated fields to democratize the research process, ensuring that community members are involved in decisions around research, including setting priorities for research, its design and implementation, and interpretation and dissemination of the findings (e.g., Hickey, 2018; Israel et al., 2005; Jones & Wilsdon, 2018). Involving community members in this way—that is, doing participatory autism research—has the potential to make scientific discoveries more thoroughly relevant to communities, tailored to the realities of their everyday lives and consistent with their values (Chalmers, 2004; Lloyd & White, 2011). Weksler-Derri, Shwed, and Davidovitch (2019) describes one particular variant of this change—research that involved an advisory committee comprised of autistic adults, some who were members of the Autistic Community of Autistic Adults in Israel (ACI) and some who were not, who provided their experiential expertise (cf. Collins & Evans, 2002; Milton, 2014) on the research measures, qualitative themes, and research outcomes. As Weksler-Derri et al. (2019) point out, involving community members in research in this way can raise ethical issues that go beyond more traditional forms of research and which can pose challenges to regulatory governance frameworks, codes of conduct, and ethics review procedures (Banks et al., 2013; Flicker, Travers, Guta, McDonald, & Meagher, 2007; Wilson, Kenny, & Dickson-Swift, 2018). In this instance, the challenges include identifying which community members should be included on advisory boards and how the general commitment to anonymity in the research process should be treated when community participants evince a desire to set such a commitment to one side. In the current article, however, Weksler-Derri et al. (2019) attempt to resolve these ethical disputes without explicit reference to the fundamental ideal underlying this kind of work. This strikes us as a mistake. A compelling foundational ideal can play a key point of reference in ongoing ethical discussion and consideration, making the absence of one from Weksler-Derri et al.’s (2019) discussion problematic. This absence makes it extremely difficult to resolve the practical ethical issues that arise during a participatory research process, as there is little way of ranking potential outcomes against each other. Identifying such an overarching ideal can be difficult, of course, and that difficulty might explain the absence here. There are many potentially compelling commitments that arise in complex matters of research into health and wellbeing, and they can often appear incompatible. Fortunately, the very notion of “democratizing” the research process—a notion that is at least implicit in the current article—could have provided a means by which to identify such an ideal. In the remainder of this brief commentary, we set out how that could have worked. The desire to “democratize” any process involves recognizing that each participant deserves some equality of respect in that process and that means, in turn, that they must be granted relative equality of standing in any decision-making process (Allen, 2016). This, in turn, requires that inequalities of power and influence, often either hidden or ignored in the research process, become the subject of considerable ethical attention. Such inequalities of power and influence matter both because they are likely to have arbitrarily emerged across time and because they are likely to result in one participant or groups of participants having greater or lesser respect and standing than others in the research process. Elucidating the ideal in this way would enable a far clearer approach to the ethical issues raised by Weksler-Derri et al. (2019) to emerge. To give some examples: being alert to the need to ensure all participants are granted equality of respect and standing should lead researchers—and ethical review 858524 JREXXX10.1177/1556264619858524aJournal of Empirical Research on Human Research EthicsPellicano and Stears research-article2019},

  abstract = {Historically, autistic people have often been framed out of contributing towards the decisions that directly affect their own lives. This is despite a background of changing national and international policy and legislation regarding obtaining the views of disabled people in the delivery of services and within research practices (Pellicano et al. 2013). This is possibly most highlighted by the lack of autistic involvement and representation in many of the organisations that have been set up to advocate for the needs of autistic people. As this chapter indicates however, this is perhaps slowly beginning to change in some contexts, although many barriers still exist in regard to participation in wider social life, with many autistic-led advocacy groups rallying behind the call for ‘nothing about us, without us’ (e.g. ASAN, 2011; Autistic-UK, 2019). As autistic self-advocacy and rights groups have grown over the last two or three decades, there has also been a growing conflict between the autistic community ‘voice’ often championing the concept of neurodiversity and a social model of disability (or some variant thereof) and a discourse based in an individualised medical model of dysfunction, deficiency and dependency. In this chapter, an overview will be given to numerous participatory projects based primarily in the context of work happening in the United Kingdom will be given. This is due to how the UK could be said to be further along this path than most. Reference will also be made to efforts outside the UK.},

  abstract = {'Participatory autism research' refers to ways of involving autistic people and their allies (e.g. family members) in making decisions about research. These decisions can include what research gets done, how it gets done and how research findings are used. While there is more and more interest in participatory autism research, we know little about how researchers at different stages of their careers use this approach. To find out more, we discussed these issues with 25 researchers. Fourteen of these were at an early stage of their careers, and 11 were more senior researchers. We spoke to people in individual interviews or in groups. We then used a technique called thematic analysis to analyse our data, which involved us looking for common topics or 'themes' discussed by our participants. What did we find? Our participants told us that participatory autism research was a flexible approach, meaning that autistic people can be involved in research in many different ways. While people viewed this flexibility in a positive way, it also caused some confusion about what does or does not 'count' as participatory research. Our participants also spoke about how important it was to build relationships with those involved in their research, but they also said it could be difficult to communicate well with diverse groups of people who may not have much experience of research. Finally, our participants said it was hard to do participatory research when there was not much time, funding or support available to researchers. In this article, we discuss these findings, focusing on what needs to change to ensure that autistic people and their allies are meaningfully involved in autism research.},

This Primer sets out key considerations for the design of a PAR project. The core of the Primer introduces six building blocks for PAR project design: building relationships; establishing working practices; establishing a common understanding of the issue; observing, gathering and generating materials; collaborative analysis; and planning and taking action. We discuss key challenges faced by PAR projects, namely, mismatches with institutional research infrastructure; risks of co-option; power inequalities; and the decentralizing of control. To counter such challenges, PAR researchers may build PAR-friendly networks of people and infrastructures; cultivate a critical community to hold them to account; use critical reflexivity; redistribute powers; and learn to trust the process. PAR’s societal contribution and methodological development, we argue, can best be advanced by engaging with contemporary social movements that demand the redressingl of inequities and the recognition of situated expertise.},

  abstract         = {Background
Open research broadly refers to a set of practices that aim to increase transparency, rigor, reproducibility and inclusivity of research. Participatory research refers to incorporating the views and sharing power with the autism community to decide what research gets done, how it is done and how it is implemented. There is growing interest in both open and participatory practices in autism research. To date, however, these practices have tended to be considered separately.
Method
In this paper, we outline the value of both open and participatory approaches to the autism research field, highlighting key points of overlap.
Results
We propose three core principles underpinning open and participatory autism research: (1) the need for adequate expertise and infrastructure to facilitate high quality research, (2) the need for a greater degree of accessibility at all stages of the research process, and (3) the need to foster trusting relationships between the autistic and research communities.
Conclusion
There are various challenges and opportunities of adopting open and participatory principles in autism research. We hope our principles support researchers to embed these approaches more fully within their work.},

These considerations are particularly salient when conducting research with historically marginalized groups, including neurodivergent people. However, research foregrounding the first-person perspectives of neurodivergent children is still limited. In this paper, we discuss the application of creative qualitative research methods when conducting research with neurodivergent children with a range of communication and wider skill profiles. The benefits and challenges of each method are considered, drawing on examples from the first phase of an ongoing longitudinal study. Additional considerations for working ethically and respectfully with neurodivergent children are discussed. Readers are encouraged to consider how best to adapt their research protocols when working with neurodivergent children, in order to minimize research hierarchies, build positive relationships, and produce rich and meaningful data.},

Community Partnered Participatory Research is a research methodology that aims to share power between researchers and members of the researched community. There is some precedent for Community Partnered Participatory Research in Autism research, but it is still quite uncommon. At the start of our new research study (called Autism: From Menstruation to Menopause), we created a community council. For the first six meetings, our council was made up of four Autistic community members who were experienced in Autism advocacy and activism and three Autistic researchers. We seven are the authors of this article. In these first six meetings, we made plans for recruiting a larger number of lay community members who would join us later for the rest of the project (8 years in total). In this article, we describe and reflect what it felt like during these first six meetings to be part of a community research council where everybody is Autistic. We discuss how we co-created a safe space, how we helped each other feel valued and how we worked together to support each other's sometimes-differing access needs so that everyone could fully participate. We provide recommendations for how to support Autistic people to lead research on their own terms with their unique insights.},

The authors’ dialogical method of reflecting on and sharing interpretations of various project issues is then explored. The authors provide a description of how they employed this dialogical method both during the research phase (i.e., describing) and in the composition of this chapter (i.e., our meta-thinking and collective reflection). The chapter underscores the significance of cross-fertilizing knowledge and establishing equitable collaborative relationships and emphasizes the value of diversity and plurality of knowledge. The chapter also highlights the necessity, particularly in neuromixed teams, of reflecting on one’s standpoint to foster joint political engagement and inclusive practices. It further debates the rebalancing of power relations and offers directions for achieving this, such as having a high proportion of Autistic members, ensuring equal compensation, and practicing power redistribution among allistic members. Finally, we reflect on how these issues and learning manifested during the project and within the neuromixed research collective as well as how the dialogical method deepened them.},

The aim of this network has been to build a community where those who wished to see more significant involvement of autistic people in autism research could share their knowledge and expertise and lessen their isolation. By doing so, it was hoped that this would potentially strengthen research collaborations and give a platform for participatory research. PARC was created by the coming together of researchers working on various projects at London South Bank University (LSBU). Initially envisaged as potentially a research centre at the University, this was altered to a broader (initially national) network that would not be solely based at or dependent on a single institution. This change was inspired by a previous workshop series entitled the ‘Theorising Autism Project’ (Greenstein, 2014), which ran between 2012 and 2014 and was led by some of those who helped to initiate PARC. The first workshop in this series was centred on the topic of education, yet the issue of participation was highlighted very strongly at this meeting and led to the second workshop of this series being based on this as a main topic. This experience was a primary factor in the formation of PARC. (...)},

Participants identified patient-level, autism-related factors that impact healthcare interactions, including verbal communication skills, sensory sensitivities, challenges with body awareness, slow processing speed, atypical non-verbal communication, and challenges with organization. However, the success of healthcare interactions largely depended on the interplay between patient- and provider-level factors, as well as the larger context in which patients were receiving care. Provider-level factors included providers’ knowledge about autism in adults, incorrect assumptions about individual patients, willingness to allow written communication, use of accessible language, openness to providing other accommodations, and skill in appropriately incorporating supporters. System-level factors included the availability of supporters, complexity of the healthcare system, accessibility of healthcare facilities, and stigma about autism. Further efforts are needed to empower patients, adequately train providers, increase the accessibility of the healthcare system, and decrease discrimination.},

One is to hold roundtable discussions with experts in the field. Our first roundtable discussion concerns the topic of autism and empathy, a hotly debated construct within and outside academia.1    As early as 1962, psychologists described children with “autistic psychopathy” as being “unable to achieve empathy.”2 An empathy deficit has since become a core feature in many conceptualizations of autism, including the theory of mind (or mind-blindness) model and the empathizing-systematizing model.3 Researchers have distinguished between cognitive empathy (or theory of mind; the capacity to understand another person's perspective or mental state) and emotional or affective empathy (the capacity to experience affective reactions to the observed experiences of others), asserting that autistic individuals have deficits in the former, but not in the latter.4,5 Even this position, however, has been widely criticized by autistic individuals in online forums. For example, purported deficits in cognitive empathy may be a problem of experiencing too much emotional empathy or of needing more time to process empathy's cognitive aspects.6 Or they may be due to a breakdown in mutual understanding between people who experience the world differently (and may apply just as much to neurotypical people failing to empathize with autistic people as it does in the opposite direction).7 Autistic adults often argue that the notion that autistic individuals lack empathy or theory of mind is dehumanizing and perpetuates dangerous stereotypes and oversimplifications.6    Following is a transcript of our roundtable discussion, with minor edits for clarity.},

Our objective was to create practice-based guidelines for the inclusion of autistic adults, both as research team members and as study participants. We conducted an institutional ethnography of three closely related research partnerships that used participatory methods with autistic adults over the years 2006–2018. We used an iterative approach which combined discussions with community and academic partners and artifact review. Guidelines to promote the inclusion of autistic adults as co-researchers focus on being transparent about partnership goals, clearly defining roles and choosing partners, creating processes for effective communication and power-sharing, building and maintaining trust, disseminating findings, encouraging community capacitation, and fairly compensating partners. Guidelines to promote the inclusion of autistic adults as study participants focus on maximizing autonomy and inclusion, creating an accessible consent process, offering multiple modes of participation, adapting survey instruments for use with autistic adults, creating accessible qualitative interview guides, and handling data from proxy reporters. Although these practice-based guidelines may not apply to all research teams, we hope that other researchers can capitalize on these practical lessons when including autistic adults in research.},

  abstract = {Background: Although autistic adults often discuss experiencing ‘‘autistic burnout’’ and attribute serious negative outcomes to it, the concept is almost completely absent from the academic and clinical literature.
Methods: We used a community-based participatory research approach to conduct a thematic analysis of 19 interviews and 19 public Internet sources to understand and characterize autistic burnout. Interview participants were autistic adults who identified as having been professionally diagnosed with an autism spectrum condition. We conducted a thematic analysis, using a hybrid inductive–deductive approach, at semantic and latent levels, through a critical paradigm. We addressed trustworthiness through multiple coders, peer debriefing, and examination of contradictions.
Results: Autistic adults described the primary characteristics of autistic burnout as chronic exhaustion, loss of skills, and reduced tolerance to stimulus. They described burnout as happening because of life stressors that added to the cumulative load they experienced, and barriers to support that created an inability to obtain relief from the load. These pressures caused expectations to outweigh abilities resulting in autistic burnout. Autistic adults described negative impacts on their health, capacity for independent living, and quality of life, including suicidal behavior. They also discussed a lack of empathy from neurotypical people and described acceptance and social support, time off/reduced expectations, and doing things in an autistic way/unmasking as associated in their experiences with recovery from autistic burnout.
Conclusions: Autistic burnout appears to be a phenomenon distinct from occupational burnout or clinical depression. Better understanding autistic burnout could lead to ways to recognize, relieve, or prevent it, including highlighting the potential dangers of teaching autistic people to mask or camouflage their autistic traits, and including burnout education in suicide prevention programs. These findings highlight the need to reduce discrimination and stigma related to autism and disability.},

Many professionals working with Autistic adults in research, clinical, and educational settings devote their careers to trying to improve such outcomes. However, we maintain that real progress cannot happen without a fundamental mindshift. The status quo for professionals is to view autism as an illness. Instead, the neurodiversity movement encourages us to value and embrace autism as an aspect of human diversity and asks us to view Autistic people as a marginalized group that experiences significant disparities. While some professionals may be adopting language and concepts from the neurodiversity movement, we argue that making this mindshift fundamentally changes our practice across research, clinical, and educational settings. In this perspective, we call on professionals to embrace this mindshift to reduce discrimination and stigma, halt the spread of harmful ideologies, and help Autistic adults live fulfilling lives.},

  abstract = {Background—Most community-based participatory research ({CBPR}) projects involve local communities defined by race, ethnicity, geography, or occupation. Autistic self-advocates, a geographically dispersed community defined by disability, experience issues in research similar to those expressed by more traditional minorities.
Objectives—We sought to build an academic–community partnership that uses {CBPR} to improve the lives of people on the autistic spectrum.
Methods—The Academic Autistic Spectrum Partnership in Research and Education ({AASPIRE}) includes representatives from academic, self-advocate, family, and professional communities. We are currently conducting several studies about the health care experiences and well-being of autistic adults. Lessons Learned—We have learned a number of strategies that integrate technology and process to successfully equalize power and accommodate diverse communication and collaboration needs.
Conclusions—{CBPR} can be conducted successfully with autistic self-advocates. Our strategies may be useful to other {CBPR} partnerships, especially ones that cannot meet in person or that include people with diverse communication needs.},

  abstract = {H istorically, few autism researchers have been openly autistic. Indeed, the institutions, practices, and culture of autism research have largely been shaped by nonautistic people. Insofar as nonautistic people may struggle to understand autistic perspectives and communicate effectively with autistic people, as suggested by the concept of the double empathy problem and by empirical research, this could have serious repercussions for the quality and relevance of autism research. Fortunately, a growing number of openly autistic scholars have begun to make their presence known in the autism field. For example, autistic researchers are visible in the Participatory Autism Research Collective, in the International Society for Autism Research (INSAR) Autistic Researchers Committee, in social media groups for autistic researchers, and via the #AutisticsinAcademia hashtag, and through numerous other initiatives and organizations, including this journal. Although these autistic autism researchers might be well positioned to act as a countervailing force against the double empathy problem, being autistic in a field shaped and dominated by nonautistic people could also be a source of challenges and tensions. Unfortunately, no academic articles focusing on autistic scholars in autism research currently exist in the literature, which could impede efforts to promote the success of autistic autism researchers. This roundtable discussion provides an initial exploration of this important topic. This discussion focuses specifically on autistic scholars—such as graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty—who are conducting autism and disability research. We chose this focus to allow a more in-depth discussion. As such, this roundtable does not focus on the involvement of autistic people in autism research as community partners or coresearchers. Although the involvement of autistic community members in research teams is an important topic for the field, it has been discussed in other publications. Furthermore, while the accessibility of university-based clinical programs (e.g., medical, education, social work, and clinical psychology) does affect the representation of autistic people in occupations that are responsible for providing important services and supports to autistic individuals, this is a distinct and separate topic from autism research. Finally, this roundtable does not explore experiences of autistic people conducting research in fields unrelated to autism. It is possible that being an autistic researcher in nonautism fields may be associated with some tensions and challenges that meaningfully differ from tensions facing autistic autism researchers.},

We outline the scientific developments that have provoked the most discomfort, analyze the response to these developments from within and without the autism community, and trace the current state of the ethical debate. Having done so, we contend that these ethical questions are unlikely to be resolved as they depend on fundamentally conflicting assumptions about the nature and desirability of neurocognitive difference.

Research into effective ways of responding to the immediate needs of autistic people is, however, less advanced, as are efforts at translating basic science research into service provision. Involving community members in research is one potential way of reducing this gap. This study therefore investigated the views of community involvement in autism research both from the perspectives of autism researchers and of community members, including autistic adults, family members and practitioners. Results from a largescale questionnaire study (n = 1,516) showed that researchers perceive themselves to be engaged with the autism community but that community members, most notably autistic people and their families, did not share this view. Focus groups/interviews with 72 participants further identified the potential benefits and remaining challenges to involvement in research, especially regarding the distinct perspectives of different stakeholders. Researchers were skeptical about the possibilities of dramatically increasing community engagement, while community members themselves spoke about the challenges to fully understanding and influencing the research process. We suggest that the lack of a shared approach to community engagement in {UK} autism research represents a key roadblock to translational endeavors.},

This article reports on the outcomes from the series, identifying five topics relevant to building a community of practice in participatory research: Respect, Authenticity, Assumptions, Infrastructure and Empathy. Each topic is connected to a specific example from within and beyond research, to inspire new practices in the field. We call for the development of participatory research skills among the autism research community and the facilitation of greater autistic leadership of, and partnership in, research.

Increasingly, there have been calls from the autistic community and, more recently, nonautistic researchers, to rethink the way in which autism science is framed and conducted. Neurodiversity, where autism is seen as one form of variation within a diversity of minds, has been proposed as a potential alternative paradigm. In this review, we concentrate on three major challenges to the conventional medical paradigm – an overfocus on deficits, an emphasis on the individual as opposed to their broader context and a narrowness of perspective – each of which necessarily constrains what we can know about autism and how we are able to know it. We then outline the ways in which fundamental elements of the neurodiversity paradigm can potentially help researchers respond to the medical model’s limitations. We conclude by considering the implications of a shift towards the neurodiversity paradigm for autism science.},

  abstract = {Despite calls for increased community engagement in autism research, the published evidence base suggests that participatory autism research remains rare. This study examined the extent and nature of community engagement in Australian research projects commissioned by the Autism CRC. Data were gathered using an online survey, comprising quantitative scale items and qualitative free-text responses, which was completed by 64 academic partners and 15 community partners. Quantitative findings indicated that autism research stakeholders in Australia are largely supportive of community engagement in research and have had positive experiences of participatory research. These findings were not wholly corroborated by the qualitative findings, however, which suggested that participants lacked understanding of participatory research, and held attitudes that may hinder the conduct of successful participatory research. Systemic issues within research settings were also perceived to impede community engagement in research. Both academic and community partners would benefit from better understanding of participatory research approaches, paired with practical and epistemological shifts at the systemic level, to ensure that future community engagement in autism research is respectful, equitable and beneficial to all stakeholders.
Lay abstract
Participatory research means working together (engaging) with the community that is affected by research to make decisions about that research. Participatory research is common in some fields, but it is still rare in autism research. In this study, we wanted to find out how Australian autism researchers and community members feel about participatory research. We worked with an Autistic Advisory Group to design this study, understand the results and write this article. We asked 127 people, all working on research from the Cooperative Research Centre for Living with Autism, to complete an online survey about participatory research. The survey included some questions that were answered on rating scales, and some where participants wrote their own answers. Seventy-nine people (64 researchers and 15 community members) completed most or all of the survey. The rating scales showed that most participants (82\%) supported moderate or extensive community engagement in research, and most participants (72\%) thought there should be more community engagement in autism research. In general, the participants rated their experiences of participatory research positively. Using the participants’ own written answers, we found four main ideas: (1) participatory research is important, but difficult; (2) many people do not fully understand what participatory research is; (3) academics and community members do not work together as = and (4) research systems are not designed for participatory research. Our results suggest that autism researchers and community members want to do more participatory research, but they might need training, support and funding to do participatory research well.},

Yet, we know little about the ways in which stakeholders practice and experience community engagement in autism research. In this study, we interviewed 20 stakeholders (academics, autistic people, family members/careers, research students, and service providers) regarding their experiences of community engagement in Australian autism research. Through reflexive thematic analysis of interview data, we generated four themes. First, our participants perceived academia as an “ivory tower,” disconnected from community members’ lives and priorities. Second, our participants identified that different stakeholders tended to hold different roles within their research projects: academics typically retained power and control, while community members’ roles tended toward tokenism. Third, our participants spoke of the need to “bridge the gap” between academia and the community, highlighting communication, accessibility, and planning as key to conducting effective participatory research. Lastly, participants emphasized the changing nature of autism research, describing participatory research as “the way of the future.” Our findings reflect both the progress achieved to date, and the challenges that lie ahead, as the field advances toward genuine co-production of autism research.},

  abstract = {There is little comprehensive research into autistic adulthood, and even less into the services and supports that are most likely to foster flourishing adult autistic lives. This limited research is partly because autism is largely conceived as a condition of childhood, but this focus of research has also resulted from the orthodox scientific approach to autism, which conceptualizes autistic experience almost entirely as a series of biologically derived functional deficits. Approaching autism in this way severely limits what is known about this neurodevelopmental difference, how research is conducted and the services and supports available. In this Review, we adopt an alternative research strategy: we apply Martha Nussbaum’s capabilities approach, which focuses on ten core elements of a thriving human life, to research on autistic adulthood. In doing so, we identify areas where autistic adults thrive and where they often struggle, and highlight issues to which researchers, clinicians and policymakers should respond. The resulting picture is far more complex than conventional accounts of autism imply. It also reveals the importance of engaging autistic adults directly in the research process to make progress towards genuinely knowing autism and supporting flourishing autistic lives. The focus on functional deficits in conventional autism research constrains understanding of autistic lives. In this Review, Pellicano et al. appraise research on autistic adulthood through a capabilities lens to identify areas where autistic adults thrive, and where more research and services are needed to enhance their quality of life.},

This participatory approach underpins discussions regarding autistic involvement with issues from social policy, human rights, justice and accessibility rights, through to meaningful and effective approaches to clinical, medical, therapeutic and educational practices. The heart of the message is, in part, about acceptance: embracing and valuing autism as part of the human spectrum. It is also about ensuring that meaningful change can be driven by those who have a true and deep understanding of the strengths and needs from their own experiential expertise. The slogan that best captures this idea – ‘nothing about us without us’ – rings especially true within the world of research, with implications for both what research is done and how it is conducted. Autism researchers have responded across the world. There is a deepening recognition that having rigorous methodological design that is participatory in nature improves the outcomes of research (den Houting et al., 2021; Fletcher-Watson et al., 2019; Gillespie-Lynch et al., 2017; Nicolaidis et al., 2019; Pellicano, 2020; Pellicano et al., 2021). In addition, there is a growing appreciation that participation helps researchers to translate their ideas more effectively into recommendations for concrete change in clinical or educational practice or broader public policy (Adams et al., 2018; Benevides et al., 2020; Gillespie-Lynch et al., 2021; Leadbitter et al., 2021; Shattuck et al., 2018; Warner et al., 2019). It is indisputable, therefore, that participatory research is gaining momentum among autism researchers. It remains, however, far from the dominant approach. In practice, much autism research continues to exclude autistic input except in the capacity of a research participant (FletcherWatson et al., 2019; Milton & Bracher, 2013; Milton et al., 2019) and those few studies that include autistic people in the decisions around research are all too often tokenistic in nature (den Houting et al., 2021). Indeed, as Milton (2019) argues, autistic people have traditionally been viewed as the subjects on which research is conducted rather than cast in the role of researcher. To try to capture this reality, recent investigations in different countries have sought to compare the interests of autistic people themselves with the interests of autism researchers (e.g. Benevides et al., 2020; Cusack & Sterry, 2016; Frazier et al., 2018; Pellicano et al., 2014). In Australia, this has led to a recent publication of a report by the Australian Autism Research Council (AARC), a group of community members from different stakeholder groups, including autistic people, parents and carers and researchers, which sits under the auspices of the Cooperative Research Centre for Living with Autism (AARC, 2021b). The AARC seeks to understand the research priorities of the autistic and autism communities. It derived its answers in the most straightforward way: by directly asking autistics and related community members to reflect on the kind of research that they wanted to see prioritised (AARC, 2021b). For the past 3 years, the AARC has collaborated with the autistic and autism communities to better understand and identify their priorities for research. In 2019, more than 1000 community members helped identify 10 broad research priority areas to improve understanding of the diverse experiences, preferences, and needs of communities across the autism spectrum and lifespan. In 2021, the AARC sought to delve deeper into five of the areas, including communication, education, employment, health and well-being, and justice, to identify more fine-grained research questions. In so doing, a diverse range of autistic people, parents, carers and family members of autistic children or adults and professionals with relevant expertise were recruited into the working groups for each of the five priority areas with a small number of ‘priority perspectives’ proactively included for each. For example, the communication priority working group included autistic people who communicate through non-traditional means; autistic people and family members who had experienced challenges due to a lack of communication supports; autistic people from non-English speaking backgrounds; and professionals working in relevant fields. In-depth discussions and consultation yielded ten research questions for each of the five areas (AARC, 2021a). Across these research priority areas, there are clear thematic undercurrents – which, in hindsight, are unsurprising. First, the topics are almost exclusively focused on improving understanding of the diverse experiences, preferences and needs of autistic people, while also developing knowledge, understanding and approaches to inform policy, practices and supports. Second, the priorities identified often reflect the importance of training and development, particularly for Meaningful research for autistic people?

  abstract = {Introduction
Autistic advocates and their supporters have long argued that conventional research practices provide too few opportunities for genuine engagement with autistic people, contributing to social disenfranchisement among autistic people. We recently described one attempt to develop and implement a participatory study in which a team of autistic and nonautistic researchers worked together to gather life histories from late-diagnosed autistic people. In the current study, we sought to understand the impact of this participatory approach on the participants themselves.


Methods
We spoke to 25 Australian late-diagnosed autistic adults (aged 45-72 years), who had been interviewed by an autistic researcher using an oral history approach. We asked them about their experience of being involved in that project and the research process more broadly. We thematically analyzed participants' interviews.


Results
Participants responded overwhelmingly positively to the opportunity to tell their life history, considering it illuminating and empowering. While recounting their life history was often described as "exhausting" and "draining," participants also reported feeling "supported all the way" and agreed "it was made easier because I had an autistic researcher interviewing me." One participant went so far as to say that they "probably would have dropped out [of the project] if it was run by people who weren't autistic."


Conclusions
These findings demonstrate that the benefits of coproduction to researchers and community partners extend to study participants and to the quality of the research itself. Involving autistic partners in the research process, especially in its implementation, can play a crucial role in enhancing autism research.},

  abstract = {There has been intense debate within the autistic and autism communities about the use of autism biobanks – repositories containing biological and phenotypic materials – and of genomic autism research more broadly. Here, we sought to understand the views and experiences of those contributing to one specific biobank, the Australian Autism Biobank. We adopted a multi-informant approach, conducting semi-structured interviews with 77 people, including 18 autistic probands, 46 parents and seven siblings, all of whom donated material to the Biobank, as well as six researchers employed on the project. Specifically, we asked: what motivated participants and researchers to contribute to the Australian Autism Biobank? And how did they feel about their involvement in that process? We analysed the data using reflexive thematic analysis, adopting an inductive approach within an essentialist framework. We identified three themes, which revealed a wide diversity of viewpoints, including positive conceptualisations of autism linked to neurodiversity and more negative conceptualisations linked to hopes for the development of genetic screening and reproductive choice. These findings have implications for the meaning, value and future directions of autism science. This research has been conducted using the Australian Autism Biobank resource. Lay abstract A lot of autism research has focused on finding genes that might cause autism. To conduct these genetic studies, researchers have created ‘biobanks’ – collections of biological samples (such as blood, saliva, urine, stool and hair) and other health information (such as cognitive assessments and medical histories). Our study focused on the Australian Autism Biobank, which collected biological and health information from almost 1000 Australian autistic children and their families. We wanted to know what people thought about giving their information to the Biobank and why they chose to do so. We spoke to 71 people who gave to the Biobank, including 18 autistic adolescents and young adults, 46 of their parents and seven of their siblings. We also spoke to six researchers who worked on the Biobank project. We found that people were interested in giving their information to the Biobank so they could understand why some people were autistic. Some people felt knowing why could help them make choices about having children in the future. People also wanted to be involved in the Biobank because they believed it could be a resource that could help others in the future. They also trusted that scientists would keep their information safe and were keen to know how that information might be used in the future. Our findings show that people have lots of different views about autism biobanks. We suggest researchers should listen to these different views as they develop their work.},

We suggest that the hidden biases, methodological errors, and key assumptions of autism science have obscured answers to this question. Here, we seek to initiate a broader discussion about what the foundations for a good Autistic life might be and how this discussion might be framed. Recent Findings We identify five ways in which autism science can help us all to secure those foundations, including by (1) giving Autistic well-being prominence in research, (2) amplifying Autistic autonomy, (3) attending better to everyday experiences, (4) acknowledging context, and (5) working in partnership with Autistic people and their families and allies to ensure that they are at the heart of research decision-making. Summary Such an approach would direct the focus of autism research to help shape good Autistic lives.},

@article{Natri2023,
  abstract = {Singer et al. (2023) argue that the current lexical shift within autism research towards more neutral terminology hinders accurate scientific description of the wide range of autistic experiences, particularly within clinical and medical contexts. We disagree with these claims. Semantic guidelines for referring to disability, gender, race, and ethnicity are established components of research dissemination (e.g., Clauss-Ehlers et al., 2019), and are more, not less, scientifically precise. Recommendations informed by self-advocates are widely recognized as vital tools for mitigating societal biases—reflected and reinforced by language choices—that harm marginalized communities, including disabled individuals (Scully, 2008). Examples include the American Psychological Association’s bias-free and inclusive language guidelines (APA, 2021) and the National Institute of Mental Health’s ​​Stigma and Discrimination Research Toolkit (NIMH, n.d.). The language guidelines for autism research that Singer et al. object to were developed through diverse collaborations of autistic and nonautistic researchers, clinicians, scholars, and caregivers, informed by decades of intersectional, multidisciplinary autistic and disability rights scholarship. Specific recommendations, such as replacing terms like “risk” and “co-morbid” with the accurate equivalents “likelihood” and “co-occurring” offer a more inclusive alternative to the deficit construals that predominate most published autism research (Botha & Cage, 2022). Practical and inclusive terminology enables discussion of heterogeneity in autism presentation, is less likely to reinforce bias, and is more respectful than terminology with negative connotations. Importantly, these suggestions align with guidance from autistic people designated “profoundly autistic” (Whitty, 2020; Zimmerman, 2023) as well as broader autistic preferences (Keating et al., 2022). In contrast, the terms “required” by Singer et al. (e.g., “profound autism,” “severe,” and “challenging behavior”) are limited in their validity, utility, and specificity, are inconsistently defined, and dehumanizing to many autistic people (Kapp, 2023; Pukki et al., 2022). Specific descriptors of cognitive functioning, support needs, or other characteristics of autistic people are more precise and scientifically accurate than ambiguous terms like “profound” and “severe,” which gloss over strengths and the contexts in which impairments can become significantly disabling. Language consistent with existing guidelines can be used to describe differences that are disabling or impairing and their impact. Moreover, Singer et al. mischaracterize the guidelines’ more nuanced engagement with difference and disability as describing “a simple ‘difference’.” Singer et al. assert that some autism researchers have been denied funding and have experienced heckling at public presentations due to language choices, citing a handful of tweets out of their original context. We do not condone harassment and would hope that feedback is delivered respectfully and with the intent to educate, not harm. Still, nonautistic people hold nearly all the power in autism research, including funding and publishing decisions. Members of the public have few opportunities to engage with researchers, and open platforms such as social media enable direct engagement between researchers and communities. Autism researchers should expect their work to be consumed and critiqued by the public, including autistic people affected by their research. Such critique is not bullying or weaponization, but feedback that offers autism researchers an opportunity for reflection and dialogue with the wider autistic community they purport​​ to serve. Autism researchers with concerns about how their work will be received should proactively seek guidance and consultation from autistic scholars and self-advocates. Further, Singer et al. claim that language guidelines “should not be dictated by mostly white, non-Hispanic individuals.” This statement reflects an ignorance of the scholarship of autistic people of color who have contributed to language guidance, including those designated as “profoundly autistic” and their families (Malone et al., 2022; McGann, 2021). These contributions have been made despite the significant barriers and discrimination that contribute to the pervasive underrepresentation of marginalized perspectives in the field. This includes autistic researchers (including minimally or nonspeaking), Indigenous and those representing the Global Majority, and others who endure the ongoing and disparate consequences of biased language and research agendas (Jones, 2022; Jones & Mandell, 2020). Tackling this power imbalance and increasing accountability is essential for improving autism research. Received: 17 January 2023 Accepted: 11 March 2023},

People agreed strongly that research can play a powerful role in shaping good Autistic lives. They also felt that big changes were needed for research to do this. Some of these changes were that researchers should stop thinking about autism narrowly and in a negative way, where Autistic people are seen as the problem. Researchers need to think more about how to improve systems, experiences and how other people respond to Autistic people. They also want the autism community to be more involved in what is researched and how it is researched.

  abstract = {Participatory methods are having sweeping effects on research across the globe. To facilitate transparency around these methods, Autism introduced mandatory reporting of community involvement in January 2021. Here, we sought to determine the impact of this policy. To do so, we – a team of Autistic and non-autistic researchers – searched for articles published in Autism in 2019, 2 years before policy implementation, and in 2022, 1 year after. We read 283 eligible articles and double coded each article for general information and details of community involvement. We found a fivefold increase (10.3\% pre-implementation vs 54.5\% post-implementation) in the reporting of community involvement. Most articles reported involving community members distally, in consulting roles, with researchers retaining full decision-making power. Furthermore, most community involvement was reported in more applied than basic research. A significant minority of papers (17\%), however, could not be coded, owing to insufficient or vague information. While this increase in the reporting of community involvement is encouraging, more efforts need to be directed towards (1) improving the transparency in the reporting of community involvement and (2) increasing the frequency with which community members, especially Autistic people, share decision-making power equally with researchers – or even assume control of the research process.
Lay abstract
There has been a growing push for the Autistic and autism communities to be more actively involved in autism research. From January 2021, the journal Autism made it a rule for authors to report whether they involved community members in their work; and if they did, how they had done so. In this study, we wanted to see how this new rule has changed things. Our team of Autistic and non-autistic researchers read all 283 articles published in Autism in 2019, about 2 years before the rule was in place, and in 2022, about 1 year after. We recorded what each article was about and how the community was involved. We found there was an increase in how often articles talked about community involvement – from about 10\% before the rule to over 50\% after. Most of these studies, however, only involved community members giving advice, with the researchers making most decisions about the research. This was especially true for applied research (like wellbeing) rather than basic science (like causes of autism). Also, some of these articles were unclear or did not give enough information for us to understand how the community was involved. This tells us that while it is promising that more community involvement is reported, researchers need to describe this involvement more clearly. It is also important for community members to have a bigger say in research by sharing power with the researchers or even leading the research themselves.},
