# Bibliographic Database â€“ Methodology and Participation Studies

This folder contains a `.bib` file managed with **JabRef**, gathering references related to:

- participatory research and co-production frameworks,
- methodological approaches to evaluating participation,
- epistemological reflections on research involving autistic people,
- practical guides and indicator proposals from related domains (e.g., health, disability studies, citizen science).

## ðŸ“„ File: `participation_studies.bib`

This BibTeX file is intended to support the **development of indicators**, **analytic methods**, and **critical reflections** within the *Autistic Participatory Metrics* project.

It is **distinct from the corpora under analysis** (e.g., AIMS-2-TRIALS) and serves as a foundational resource for shaping the project's methodology.

The bibliographic entries contained in the `.bib` file are also available as a **structured, APA-formatted list** on the following page:

ðŸ“„ [`methodology/jabref/Export/participation_studies_list.md`](../../methodology/jabref/Export/participation_studies_list.md)

This list is **automatically generated** using a Python script available in this repository:

ðŸ›  [`scripts/apa-bib-export`](../../scripts/apa-bib-export)

The script extracts the data from the BibTeX file and reorders it as a human-readable list in `.md` or `.html` format.
