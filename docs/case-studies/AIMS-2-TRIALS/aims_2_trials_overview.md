# AIMS-2-TRIALS Consortium Overview

**AIMS-2-TRIALS** (Autism Innovative Medicine Studies-2-Trials) is a large-scale European research consortium launched in 2018 and scheduled to run until 2026. It comprises a broad programme of studies conducted by different research groups, focusing on autism across the lifespan. The overarching aim is to "explore the biology of autism to tailor treatments and develop new medicines" ([AIMS-2-TRIALS, About](https://web.archive.org/web/20250501082321/https://www.aims-2-trials.eu/about-aims-2-trials/)).

The consortium investigates how autism presents and develops in diverse individuals. A key objective is to identify biological markers that could signal whether a person has or may develop specific characteristics. Such markers may eventually support the identification of individuals who could benefit from targeted treatments. The programme also includes the testing of medications intended to address core challenges such as social difficulties, repetitive behaviours, and sensory processing issues. Additionally, AIMS-2-TRIALS seeks to accelerate the development of new treatments by establishing a Europe-wide (and international) research network ([AIMS-2-TRIALS, About](https://web.archive.org/web/20250501082321/https://www.aims-2-trials.eu/about-aims-2-trials/)).

The total funding allocated to the AIMS-2-TRIALS project amounts to €115,441,584, including €54,999,999 in European Union contributions ([IHI Project Factsheet](https://www.ihi.europa.eu/projects-results/project-factsheets/aims-2-trials)).

From the perspective of the **Autistic Participatory Metrics** project, AIMS-2-TRIALS represents a particularly significant case study. It has produced several hundred peer-reviewed publications, providing a robust corpus for empirical analysis of participatory practices. Notably, the consortium presents itself as "likely the first large-scale consortium to invite a group of autistic people and carers to get involved across the entire project" ([AIMS-2-TRIALS, Autism Representatives](https://web.archive.org/web/20250501082321/https://www.aims-2-trials.eu/about-aims-2-trials/team/autism-representatives/)).


This makes AIMS-2-TRIALS a valuable case study for assessing the forms and extent of autistic participation in research consortia, through the development and application of empirical indicators of participation across its publication corpus. This analytical approach also aligns with recent recommendations from the European Council of Autistic People (EUCAP), which explicitly call to "ensure that EU-funded research projects on autism are **independently assessed**, particularly AIMS-2-TRIALS and its possible offshoots, (...) **with close attention to the quality and sufficiency of participatory practices**."
