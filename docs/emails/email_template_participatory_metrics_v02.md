Dear contributors to autism research,

I'm currently developing a **citizen-led project** called *Autistic Participatory Metrics*, which aims to analyse how autistic participation is described in autism research publications. Our first case study focuses on the **AIMS-2-TRIALS** consortium, using a structured reporting framework (**GRIPP2-LF**) to examine several hundred peer-reviewed articles.

We are actively seeking feedback from researchers with expertise in autism studies. Any comments, questions, or suggestions ‚Äî whether methodological or conceptual ‚Äî would be most welcome.

üîó **Protocol draft**:

# Subject: Invitation to collaborate on the *Autistic Participatory Metrics* citizen-led project

My name is **C√©dric Detienne**, an autistic citizen based in Belgium. I am the initiator of [Autidacts.org](https://autidacts.org/), a volunteer-driven website that documents and shares resources related to the participatory engagement of autistic individuals in autism science ‚Äî including a list of nearly 200 autistic people involved in the field, along with selected examples of their work.

Extending the participatory focus initiated through *Autidacts.org*, which highlights contributions from autistic individuals to autism research, the **Autistic Participatory Metrics** project shifts attention from individual authorship to the ways in which participatory practices are reported within structured research outputs ‚Äî such as those emerging from academic groups, funded consortia, or collaborative projects.

Rather than identifying whether autistic people are listed as authors, the project examines *how* their involvement is described in the scientific autism literature. The aim is to support a more empirical and comparative understanding of participatory dynamics: across different research settings, and over time.

*Autistic Participatory Metrics* adopts a **citizen-led**, **transparent**, and **reproducible** approach. It combines bibliometric corpus construction with structured analysis tools ‚Äî notably the **GRIPP2-LF** checklist ‚Äî and applies a dual-reviewer process to ensure methodological consistency. The longer-term objective is to produce open-access datasets and indicators that allow for systematic cross-group and longitudinal comparisons of participatory reporting practices in autism research.

## AIMS-2-TRIALS as a Case Study

The first case study applies this framework to peer-reviewed outputs that acknowledge funding from the European consortium **AIMS-2-TRIALS** (*Autism Innovative Medicine Studies-2-Trials*). Launched in 2018 and running through 2026, AIMS-2-TRIALS is a large-scale biomedical research programme that brings together multiple research groups across Europe to investigate the biology of autism across the lifespan. With over **‚Ç¨115 million in funding** ‚Äî including **‚Ç¨55 million from the European Union** [(3)](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/777394) ‚Äî the consortium aims to identify biological markers and develop new pharmacological treatments targeting social communication, repetitive behaviours, and sensory issues.

From the perspective of the *Autistic Participatory Metrics* project, AIMS-2-TRIALS offers a particularly relevant and well-defined corpus, with several hundred peer-reviewed publications and a stated commitment to stakeholder inclusion. The consortium explicitly describes itself as ‚Äúlikely the first large-scale consortium to invite a group of autistic people and carers to get involved across the entire project.‚Äù [(4)](https://web.archive.org/web/20250501082321/https://www.aims-2-trials.eu/about-aims-2-trials/team/autism-representatives/)

This claim, along with the scale and diversity of the research outputs, makes it a strong candidate for empirical analysis of how autistic participation is described, operationalised, and reported in scientific publications. The case study also responds to recent calls ‚Äî for example, by the European Council of Autistic People (EUCAP) ‚Äî to ensure independent evaluation of EU-funded autism research initiatives, with specific attention to the scope and quality of participatory practices [(5)](https://eucap.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/EUCAP-Manifesto-2024-for-EU-Elections.pdf).

## Study Protocol

To examine this case, a dedicated study has been designed:  
**_Autistic Participation Reporting in Autism Research Articles Funded by AIMS-2-TRIALS: A Corpus Analysis Informed by GRIPP2-LF_**

The objective is to systematically assess how the participation of autistic individuals is described in the consortium‚Äôs peer-reviewed publications, using a structured and transparent approach.

**Key elements of the study include:**

- A clearly defined publication corpus, built through multi-source searches and documented using standardised procedures.
- A process for verifying the inclusion of eligible articles, involving independent reviewers.
- A reporting framework based on the GRIPP2-LF checklist, adapted to identify how participatory elements are mentioned or discussed.
- Planned results include a publicly available corpus, clear documentation of the analysis process, and a summary of the main patterns observed in how participation is reported.

A draft version of the protocol (v0.4, 2 June 2025) is available for review:

## Invitation

The *Autistic Participatory Metrics* project is still in its early stages and would greatly benefit from the insights of researchers with expertise in autism science. Given your experience in this field, your perspective would be particularly valuable ‚Äî whether in refining the approach or identifying areas we may have overlooked.

I would be grateful for any of the following:

- **Methodological feedback** on the draft protocol, including the search strategy or reporting framework.  
- **Suggestions of relevant literature** or comparable initiatives that could inform or challenge the project‚Äôs assumptions.  
- **Collaborative input** on coding or interpretation.  

Even a brief comment, question, or recommended reference would be highly appreciated and would help strengthen the transparency and relevance of the project.

## Get in Touch

There are currently three main ways to connect with others interested in the project:

- üìß **By email**: [metrics@cedricdetienne.be](mailto:metrics@cedricdetienne.be)  
- üóÇ **GitHub** (project updates, open issues): [https://github.com/cedric-detienne/Autistic-participatory-metrics](https://github.com/cedric-detienne/Autistic-participatory-metrics)  
- üí¨ **Discord** (discussion space): [https://discord.gg/9uk3cCyR9e](https://discord.gg/9uk3cCyR9e)  

Participation in the project is entirely voluntary. The initiative is fully independent, non-commercial, and open to contributions from a range of perspectives. Individuals are welcome to participate either under their real name or using a pseudonym, recognising that research on participatory practices in autism science may be sensitive in certain institutional contexts.

If the project resonates with your interests, I would be grateful for your feedback ‚Äî and, if you wish, for your involvement. Please also feel free to share this invitation with colleagues who may be interested.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of connecting.

Warm regards,  

**C√©dric Detienne**
